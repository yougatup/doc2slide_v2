    "text": "ABSTRACT Adapting an interface requires taking into account both the positive and negative efects that changes may have on the user. A carelessly picked adaptation may impose high costs to the user – for example, due to surprise or relearning efort – or “trap” the process to a suboptimal design immaturely. However, efects on users are hard to predict as they depend on factors that are latent and evolve over the course of interaction. We propose a novel approach for adaptive user interfaces that yields a conservative adaptation policy: It fnds benefcial changes when there are such and avoids changes when there are none.

This paper looks at a foundational technical problem of adaptive interfaces that lies at the intersection of human–computer interaction and machine learning research: How to select adaptations? An adaptive system must decide what to adapt, and when – or when not – to make changes. Diferent computational approaches to this problem have been studied, among others, rule-based systems, heuristics, bandits, Bayesian optimisation, and supervised learning (see section 2). Although positive empirical results have been obtained (e.g., [4, 13, 17, 46, 49, 51, 52, 54]), known approaches have been criticised for being unpredictable and unreliable; they pick detrimental adaptations unacceptably often [16, 22, 33, 36, 56]."

Utility – in this case – refers to the usefulness of an adaptation to the user, or how it is perceived to beneft interaction when possible costs are taken into account. Picking an adaptation can be considered a hypothesis on how useful it is for user. Unfortunately, utility is very hard to estimate accurately – hard both at design time as well as interactively from the kind of data these systems have access to, such as clicks or viewing duration. In machine learning terms, utility is latent. Moreover, in adaptive interaction, utility is also non-stationary. That is, the skills and interests of the user evolve over time. A change that would make sense in the beginning when the user is novice with the design may be devastating for an experienced user."

However, non-stationarity makes planning challenging: considering only a short period of time (i.e. a short horizon) can result in suboptimal designs. An adaptation that is overft to a novice could be impossible to recover from later on when the user is more experienced. On the other hand, planning a long sequence of adaptations increases the size of search space, growing exponentially with the length of the planning horizon."

We defne the adaptation problem as a stochastic sequential decision problem [7], where the adaptive system should plan a sequence of adaptations over a long horizon. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of machine learning methods appropriate for this type of problems. Typically, a policy is learnt via trial-and-error that maximises future cumulative utility. Our RL approach is model-based as it uses predictive HCI models to estimate utility. These models simulate consequences – benefts and costs – of possible adaptation sequences without actually executing them [28, 50]. However, their application is conditioned on their accuracy: They should accurately predict short-term costs such as due to relearning as well as longer-term improvements to performance. Generally, such models are available at least in the areas of pointing, menu interaction, and graphical layouts. In comparison with an alternative, the model-free approach, the model-based approach requires less training and better generalises across conditions [28, 50]. However, fnding the best adaption – by assessing the value of each sequence of adaptations with predictive models – is"

We demonstrate it specifcally in the context of adaptive menus. The task is to adapt the interface by changing the arrangement and grouping of menu items (Figure 1), thus improving the menu’s usability. We exploit and extend multiple menu search models from literature to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the value of an adaptation as well as their change as the user learns. This helps us form an adaptation policy that accounts for diferent user strategies and avoids adaptations that incur high costs to users. Our technical evaluation shows that our solution can tackle realistic problem sizes, and fnd favourable adaptations, on a commodity computer. Finally, we present results from an empirical evaluation where the approach compared favourably against a non-adaptive baseline design and a frequency-based adaptation policy."

For example, in menu-based interaction, most systems still follow a heuristic approach, where adaptation is picked based on hand-written heuristics that exploit click frequency, visit duration, recency or other specifc features that can be computed from observation data [21]. These approaches, in general, are feasible only when sensed input is highly predictive of the most appropriate adaptation. Another limitation is that writing a comprehensive and accurate rule system requires plenty of foresight. A rule system must be developed that, on the one hand, covers conceivable conditions the system can enter and, on the other, can graciously resolve conficts when multiple rules apply."

Two learning capabilities are needed: (1) inference, the capability to update assumptions about the user based on observations; and (2) decision-making, the capability to choose appropriate adaptation in the light of assumptions about the user [41]. The two challenges can be relaxed, for example if user state is trivially known, or if the state is highly predictive of appropriate adaptation. In the latter case, the problem can be approached as a supervised learning problem, where a mapping is learned between user data and suitable adaptations. While this approach has been successful for input techniques, such as gesture recognition [57], it is an open question if this scales up to adaptive interfaces, which must not only learn user state but fexibly decide how to intervene in the user interface. A practical obstacle is how to obtain a dataset that describes the consequences of possible adaptations on possible users."

It is a global optimisation method that tries to fnd optimal adaptation by probing to a black box function; here, the user. It is a robust and sample-efcient and well-suited for noisy, expensive-to-evaluate functions. The method uses a surrogate model for approximating the model ft across the parameter space and quantify uncertainty. This is necessary for the acquisition rule to address the exploration–exploitation trade-of. This way, it is possible to learn adaptive responses via trial and error. Applications have been shown in human-in-the-loop design of interface features [15] and adaptation of low-dimensional design features [30]. However, while bandits and BO have been successful in simpler adaptation problems, like recommendations and calibration of interface parameters, their intrinsic limitation is that they are myopic; that is, they do not plan over a series of changes – a capability we need in adaptive interaction."

Outside of user interfaces, we fnd applications of model-based RL, for example in board games, robots, video games [29], as well as behaviour-change applications, such as in generating behavioural instructions for people with dementia [23]. A grand obstacle for applications in adaptive systems is the model: where to get a good one? A related problem is that of drift: prediction errors can have a compounding, cumulative efect on planning performance. In HCI, although previous work has explored the use of model-free RL (e.g., see [35]), model-based RL has not been explored in adaptive interfaces at large, as far as we know. Also, while predictive models have been used for oneshot design generation [42], design space exploration [53], and for selecting a single action in a myopic manner [27, 51], they have not been used for simulation-based planning in an adaptive system."

In our case, while the system can change the interface, it cannot change the human, which has its own latent processes. For example, humans learn and change interests.

Upon adaptation, the transition function p specifes how the internal state of the user (e.g. their expertise) changes along with the external design state. The reward r then signifes the beneft an adaptation provides to the user by improving future interactions, for example, by reducing the time required to select an icon. Finally, the discount factor γ indicates to the adaptive system how immediate benefts and long-term improvements contribute towards the reward. Given this setting, the goal of the system is to fnd a suitable policy τ that can be used to select adaptations that maximise the estimated cumulative reward."

While the true state of the design is fully observable, the system does not have access to the true state of the user. We can only estimate it through HCI models, where predictions provide us a belief about the user status (for the theoretical implications of this, see [2]). Further, due to the lack of user feedback, computing reward is not straightforward. Instead, predictive HCI models can be used to build objective functions related to performance and re-learning costs. Note that this formulation does not take a stance on what is the ‘right’ objective function. Finally, at any given state, there is a large number of possible adaptations that can change the design. When considering a sequence of adaptations over a long horizon, the state space grows exponentially. In the following, we describe how these challenges are addressed via model-based RL."

Elementary design and user features are parameterised with the neural network model. This is then used to predict value estimates for any given state in an online setting.

Menus have received extensive attention in HCI research because they are widely used, and adaptation has potential to improve usability [4, 55]. It is known that unexpected changes in menus can introduce a temporary performance drop, increase cognitive load, and potentially lead to the rejection of the adaption/techniques [4, 55]. No general solution has been proposed for autonomous adaptation that could not only move items to the top, but handle reorganisations more comprehensively. We provide a general solution here considering linear menus with up to 20 items, which covers a wide number of menus typically found in common operating systems, applications, and websites [3, 4, 6]. As menu adaptations, we only consider those modifying the position and grouping of items in the menus, leaving other presentation adaptations, such as highlighting and split menus, for future work. While we consider linear menus with textual labels, our solution can be extended to address the problem of adaptive homescreens (introduced in section 3) by extending the menu search model to consider two-dimensional grids and graphical icons."

By simulating consequences of adaptations during roll-outs, we can estimate implications of design changes on user performance. However, given the varying length of menu sizes, running simulations with long horizons can be infeasible for online settings. For example, for a menu with 15 items, and up to 8 separators, there are over 500 feasible adaptations. To address large problem sizes, we instantiate our general network architecture (Figure 3) for adaptive menus. The key idea is to anticipate the rewards for a given menu adaptation taking into account the previous menu design and the user behaviour. The model inputs are: (1) design head: adapted menu design, association matrices of the current and adapted menu; (2) user head: previous and current clicks distribution. The model outputs reward predictions for each of the three search models: serial, foraging, and recall. Figure 6 illustrates the model architecture."

This prevents overftting the model to the training data, improving generalisability to unseen data. The loss function for all model tails is the mean squared error (MSE), which is computed as the average of the squared diferences between the predicted and the actual values, which penalises large errors. We use the RMSProp optimiser, a popular stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentums. We use learning rate η = 0.001 and decay factor β = 0.9 for the optimiser. We train the model for 200 epochs at most, using early stopping (10 epochs patience) to retain the best model weights, and monitor its performance on a validation set comprising 20% of training data. After training, our model achieved remarkable performance: MSEser ial = 0.149, MSEf oraдe = 0.408, MSEr ecall = 0.431."

However, this selection time depends not only on the cursor movement distance, but also the user’s ability to search for items in the menu. To get a better understanding of how the diferent conditions infuenced performance, we further looked at how target item positions in the menu infuence selection time. Figure 9b illustrates the linear increase in selection time with target position for the three conditions. It can be observed that while selection time for the top-most items (lower target positions) is quite similar for the three conditions, with MCTS being the fastest, it increases more drastically for the Freqency condition, as compared to Static and MCTS. When we exclude the top-three target items, the diference in selection time between MCTS (mean = 2454 ms) and Freqency (mean = 2799 ms) is 344 ms (i.e. Freqency is about 15% slower)."

Participants commented that the reordering was confusing, and prevented them from remembering item locations: “I might skip down instead of checking the top, and then go back to the top.” (P3). In the Static condition, participants could use their memory to directly access some items, but commented on the lack of proper grouping: “the items were not consistent in their grouping, and they were not intuitively grouped” (P11). In the MCTS condition, participants noticed that the categorisation of items into groups improved upon adaptation, and helped them in searching for related items: “the items were organised under categories often – that helped select items” (P18)."

First, MCTS-based planning consistently proposes adaptations that could improve predicted performance (Figure 9a). Second, as search depth increases, our results indicate that value network is more efcient for estimating reward predictions. Further, results from our user study highlight benefts over a static and an adaptive baseline. Through model-based planning, we can adapt menus that improve overall performance, as given by reduced selection time. A common pitfall of the frequencybased approach is that, although it can improve performance for commonly-used items or commands, it prevents recall and makes selection of other items increasingly difcult. In contrast, we observed (Figure 9b) that adaptations made through our approach could provide these benefts while avoiding costly changes that require relearning and cause annoyance."

First, one limitation to the applicability of the approach is the requirement for accurate models of short- and long-term consequences of adaptations. So far we have assumed that such models are expressed as step-by-step computer simulations or mathematical models. However, there is no reason why data-driven models (e.g. [59]) – trained on larger datasets of user data – could not be used for this purpose, signifcantly expanding the scope of possible applications. Second, algorithm engineering is needed to deploy this approach to larger applications. In particular, presently, with our computing resources, problem sizes of up to 20 items are still within reach in the case of menu systems. To improve performance beyond that, techniques for GPU computation and more efcient training will need attention. Finally, while our work successfully used a value network, further improvements can be expected by implementing a policy network [48]."
