    "text": "ABSTRACT How to attribute responsibility for autonomous artifcial intelligence (AI) systems’ actions has been widely debated across the humanities and social science disciplines. This work presents two experiments (N =200 each) that measure people’s perceptions of eight diferent notions of moral responsibility concerning AI and human agents in the context of bail decision-making. Using reallife adapted vignettes, our experiments show that AI agents are held causally responsible and blamed similarly to human agents for an identical task. However, there was a meaningful diference in how people perceived these agents’ moral responsibility; human agents were ascribed to a higher degree of present-looking and forward-looking notions of responsibility than AI agents. We also found that people expect both AI and human decision-makers and advisors to justify their decisions regardless of their nature. We discuss policy and HCI implications of these fndings, such as the need for explainable AI in high-stakes scenarios."

This question has been debated for over a decade since Matthias’ landmark essay on the responsibility gap of autonomous machines [68]. This gap is posed by highly autonomous and self-learning AI systems. Until now, scholars in multiple disciplines, including ethics, philosophy, computer science, and law, have suggested possible solutions to this moral and legal dilemma. Optimistic views proclaim that the gap can be bridged by proactive attitudes of AI designers, who should readily take responsibility for any harm [20, 72]. Some even propose to hold AI systems responsible per se [91], viewing human-AI collaborations as extended agencies [45, 48]. In contrast, pessimistic views question whether this gap can be bridged at all, since there might not exist appropriate subjects of retributive blame [26] nor it makes sense to hold inanimate and non-conscious entities responsible for their actions [16, 89, 96]."

Legal scholars state that punishment (which could be seen as a form of holding an agent responsible, e.g., under criminal liability) aims to reform the wrongdoers, deter re-ofenses and similar actions, and resolve retributive sentiments [4, 99]. Previous work has addressed how and why people assign responsibility to various agents. The general public might choose to hold a wrongdoer responsible for restoring moral coherence [22] or reafrming a communal moral values [109]. Psychological research indicates that people base much of their responsibility attribution on retributive sentiments rather than deterrence [18], while overestimating utilitarian goals in their ascription of punishment (i.e., responsibility) [17]. Intentionality also determines how much responsibility is assigned to an entity [70]; people look for an intentional agent to hold responsible and infer other entities’ intentionality upon failure to fnd one [40]."

Scholars have also argued that to blame someone is to respond to “the impairment of a relationship,” [21, 86] especially towards its constitutive standards [87]. Scholars have debated the possibility of ascribing blame to an automated agent and agree that doing so would not be morally appropriate [26, 96]. Regardless of this consensus, previous studies have found that people attribute a similar degree of blame to robotic and human agents under specifc conditions (e.g., [37, 67]). As an opposite concept of blame, one may consider “praise” as a positive behavioral reinforcement [51] through which one conveys its values and expectations of the agent [28].

If this causal evaluation is not successful, the model assigns little or no blame to the agent. Otherwise, the blamer evaluates the agent’s intentionality. If the action is deemed intentional, the blamer evaluates the reasons behind it and ascribes blame accordingly.

If the general public believes praising an AI system does not make sense, people might perceive blameworthiness similarly, contradicting our results. However, studies have shown a public impulse to blame, driven by the desire to express social values and expectations [18]. Psychological evidence further suggests that humans are innate retributivists [17]. Likewise, HCI research has found that people attribute blame to robotic agents upon harm, particularly if they are described to be autonomous and serve the main cause of harm [37, 52, 67]. Hence, there is no contradiction in people attributing blame to AI systems for harms, although they should not be praised for opposing consequences."

Therefore, liability is distributed across various entities, such as the government and the court per se. Addressing the statements focusing on protecting defendants’ rights, we hypothesize that people do not expect defendants to be compensated if their rights are violated. As examined above, much of the US legislature does not compensate those who have been unjustly incarcerated [88]. The respondents did not believe those harmed should, or even could, be made whole for the violation of their rights, and hence, both AI and human agents are attributed low and similar levels of liability."

Taking morality as a human-made construct [93], it may be inevitable to hold AI systems responsible alongside their users and designers so that this formulation is kept intact. Viewing responsibility concepts as social constructs that aim to achieve specifc social goals, attributing backward-looking notions of responsibility to AI systems might emphasize these goals [91]. Our study indicates these practices might not need to focus on compensating those harmed by these systems given the low attribution of liability to 3 all agents. We instead hypothesize that people might desire to hold these entities responsible for retributive motives, such as satisfying their needs for revenge [71] and bridging the retribution gap [26], as a result of human nature [25]. It is important to note that AI systems might not be appropriate subjects of (retributive) blame [26, 89], i.e., scholars argue that blaming automated agents would be wrong and unsuccessful. Future research can address which functions of responsibility attribution would satisfy this public attribution of backward-looking responsibilities to AI systems. Future studies can also address scenarios in which blame could be attributed to a higher degree, e.g., those with life-or-death consequences, such as self-driving vehicles and AI medical advisors."

From a legal perspective, attributing responsibility to these systems might obfuscate designers and users’ roles, creating human liability shields [16], i.e., stakeholders might use these automated systems as a form of protecting themselves from deserved punishment. Another possible issue is “agency laundering,” in which the systems’ designer distances itself from morally suspect actions, regardless of intentionality, by blaming the algorithm, machine, or system [82]. This form of blame-shifting has been observed, for example, when Facebook called out its algorithm for autonomously creating anti-semitic categories in its advertisement platform [1, 97]. We highlight that any responsibility practice towards AI systems should not blur the responsibility prescribed and deserved by their designers and users. Our fndings suggest that autonomous algorithms alone should not be held responsible by themselves, but rather alongside other stakeholders, so these concerns are not realized."
