Unlike communications explicitly initiated by users, our system is always-on, staying in the background and enabling remote presence without constant use. We present findings from a field study in which the system was deployed into participants’ bedrooms. The system includes an automated photo-stream (rather than video), which was found to provide a balance between the"

We show that partners value spending this time together, and hence identify a gap in the available technology in its ability to facilitate sharing of bedtime between partners. Our system is unique in specifically targeting this scenario. 3. Evaluation of a slow photo-stream as a balance between privacy and remote presence. We show that the qualities of always-on video channels are achievable with a slow photostream. 4. We introduce a collaborative drawing experience in the home environment for everyday communication. Disappearing, shared-layer real-time inking was found to be useful, versatile, and engaging communication channel, that may have many other applications."

Baishya [57] enabled sharing of everyday mundane activities through an audiovisual streaming system.

As they draw, the inking data is transferred and shown in realtime on the remote device, creating a shared inking space. All inking is in single layer, i.e. later strokes are drawn over earlier strokes regardless of who drew them. Users can select one of 8 predefined colors, 3 predefined ink thicknesses and 4 predefined ink durations (one second, one minute, one hour or one day). All strokes start linearly disappearing (i.e. becoming transparent) as soon as they are drawn, so that full transparency is reached when the selected duration passes.

All couples were heterosexual, though this was not a prerequisite. Two of the couples had remote partners in mainland Europe (France and Germany), others were separated across the UK. Despite these requirements, it later transpired that the eldest couple (C5) had not lived together before. Since these partners were in their forties, we found it valuable to keep them in the study nevertheless, however, their views on privacy might be skewed by this difference.

Through the deployment of Bedtime Window, we explored the feasibility of having a full-screen, always-on interactive device in the bedroom."

The remaining couple did not feel they need to be connected during bedtime, neither that they need any more ways to connect in general. Every couple is different, and each has their own needs and expectations that a particular design might or might not meet."

Sharing one inking space in real-time opens space for conversation, creativity and play. Ishii presented the metaphor of drawing from two sides of a glass, resulting in separated ink layers [65]. In Bedtime Window, the strokes are overlaid on a single layer, providing a new, unique experience without a corresponding physical equivalent, leading to inking meta-interactions where users alter, overwrite, annotate or decorate ink as it is appearing. This is comparable to typed-chat in which participants see messages as they are being typed (e.g. [66]), except that in this case users can actually interfere with each other’s writing."

In a similar way, the intervals by which ink disappeared were restricted, and the optimal duration for maximizing communication flow needs to be determined.
