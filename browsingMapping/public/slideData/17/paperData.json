    "text": "ABSTRACT In order to support fairness-forward thinking by machine learning (ML) practitioners, fairness researchers have created toolkits that aim to transform state-of-the-art research contributions into easily-accessible APIs. Despite these eforts, recent research indicates a disconnect between the needs of practitioners and the tools ofered by fairness research. By engaging 20 ML practitioners in a simulated scenario in which they utilize fairness toolkits to make critical decisions, this work aims to utilize practitioner feedback to inform recommendations for the design and creation of fair ML toolkits. Through the use of survey and interview data, our results indicate that though fair ML toolkits are incredibly impactful on users’ decision-making, there is much to be desired in the design and demonstration of fairness results. To support the future development and evaluation of toolkits, this work ofers a rubric that can be used to identify critical components of Fair ML toolkits."

For instance, the ML recognition systems in autonomous vehicles have been less efective in recognizing darker skin [53]; search engine results have reinforced representation bias [42]; and even professional networking sites were discovered to recommend “male-sounding” variations of names when “female-sounding” names were searched [17]. Institutions have been quick in formulating their own guidelines for confronting algorithmic bias [28]. These guidelines focus on themes like fairness, transparency, accountability, and so on [28].

Once the data was retrieved from the UCI page [19], gender, race, and the predictive class were separated for subsequent analysis and a few irrelevant attributes were removed. The attributes left for model generation were age, work class, education level, marital status, occupation, investment capital loss and gain, hours worked per week, and native country. These attributes were used to predict whether or not an individual makes over $50,000 a year.

To generate fairness diferences between models for participants to discover, we post-processed the models in the following ways: for Linear Regression and Random Forest, post-processing fairness modifcations and balancing of training data was done on the predictors. Microsoft’s FairLearn ThresholdOptimizer [39] was used to adjust these predictors to satisfy certain parity constraints. For Logistic Regression, the model was optimized to satisfy Equalized Odds, which requires that a fair classifer predict positive and negative class across groups with the same likelihood [25]. For Random Forest, the model was optimized to satisfy Demographic Parity, which states the proportion of people in each demographic group classifed in the positive class should be equivalent [30]. The Neural Network did not receive any post-processing modifcations. Each of the models were evaluated using the evaluation test set."

For each part of the notebook, users were given three questions that they must answer in the survey. These questions served multiple purposes: to compare insight and confdence when users query common data science tools like confusion matrices versus fairness toolkits and to give participants an opportunity to dig deep into the data, models, and visualizations. For each question, users provided their answer, their confdence in their answer, and can detail what type of support would strengthen their confdence. Once the six questions were complete, participants were then asked to verbalize the strengths and weaknesses they noticed for each model. From there, they were asked again their willingness to deploy each of the models. Then they completed some post-survey questions about their prior level of exposure, interests, and opinions on their respective fairness toolkit. Additional time left at the end of any session was used by the researcher to query participants about their experience, their opinions on the toolkit, and decisions they made during the study.

Many prominent toolkits are similar in this respect. However, this is not representative of the models being used in practice. Practitioners that focus on ranking, recommendation tasks, or speech synthesis found that these tools would not be easily applicable, if at all. Furthermore, P18 mentioned that group fairness was not as important as individual fairness for their work. While there exists fairness frameworks for non-traditional, non-classifcation problems [11, 45, 54], the future of fairness most defnitely requires toolkits versatile to a diverse range of machine learning tasks. The types and applications of machine learning are extensive and always growing [29]. While supervised learning is the most exemplifed in fairness literature, it is not at all generalizable to the types of models that exists that require fairness consideration. Whether it be through expanding toolkit functionality or exemplifying this extensive functionality through demos, fairness experts must demonstrate to practitioners that their toolkits are diverse in the types of models, data and predictive tasks they are given. Fair-aware methodologies for ranking, clustering, and embedding [11, 45, 54] should also be included in these toolkits. Furthermore, there should be fairness analysis options for individuals without access to sensitive features, which was a sentiment from the practitioners in this study, as well as [27]. As new methodologies for bias detection and mitigation are proposed, fair ML toolkits should work to include a diverse set of research that covers the most diverse set of existing technologies."

The impact of fair ML toolkits in this study is evident when comparing willingness to deploy models before and after fairness analysis as was seen in Figure 4. Logistic Regression received extensive support because the fair ML toolkits deemed it less ‘unfair’. Nonetheless, it still performed, with respect to performance metrics, as poorly as it had at the start of the study. This displays that over-reliance is most defnitely a concern with these technologies and, therefore, they should be accompanied by preambles that detail the limitations and dissuade over-reliance, as was shown in [37]."

P3, P11, and P20 all mentioned that it would be nice if equations for how those values are calculated were included in the visuals. Relatively, P16, who saw the Fairness Indicators tool, suggested that their tool include green and red color-coding for recommendations on fairness. Participants from previous work [27] also emphasized a need for support beyond fairness detection. Recommendations can come in many forms. While mitigation techniques are very helpful, text-based recommendations for handling diferent types of bias is also preferential to bias detection alone."

For those with similarly formatted data and access to sensitive attributes, the importance and the accessibility of fairness toolkits was made apparent. However, a large number of participants (P2, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P11, P18, P19) voiced their concerns on whether or not fairness was applicable to their work. Participants mulled over what fairness would even mean in the context of their domain. While some participants concluded that fairness (defned via group performance) was not relevant to their work, others began to formulate what fairness might look like and consider the impact of their work from a new angle. This discussion of how to defne fairness in context, determine the impact of unfairness, and decide how to respond to it is critical in team settings and the use of fair ML tools in some capacity encourages practitioners to defne fairness in their own domain. Furthermore, the diversity of fairness issues detected and the solutions ofered by practitioners suggests that this discussion might be the most pivotal frst step in incorporating fairness. The blindspots of practitioners still exist [27] and the easiest solution is one that is through collaboration. When comments were consolidated, participants in this study were able to expose more bias and propose more solutions than currently any one toolkit can provide. Therefore, the importance of fairness education for ML practitioners and fairness discussion within ML teams cannot be over-emphasized."

Furthermore, this study did not do a comparative analysis of tool features, so future work would focus on deciphering the strengths and weaknesses of toolkit features.
