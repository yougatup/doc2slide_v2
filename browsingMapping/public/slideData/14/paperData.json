    "text": "ABSTRACT Silent speech input converts non-acoustic features like tongue and lip movements into text. It has been demonstrated as a promising input method on mobile devices and has been explored for a variety of audiences and contexts where the acoustic signal is unavailable (e.g., people with speech disorders) or unreliable (e.g., noisy environment). Though the method shows promise, very little is known about peoples’ perceptions regarding using it. In this work, frst, we conduct two user studies to explore users’ attitudes towards the method with a particular focus on social acceptance and error tolerance. Results show that people perceive silent speech as more socially acceptable than speech input and are willing to tolerate more errors with it to uphold privacy and security. We then conduct a third study to identify a suitable method for providing real-time feedback on silent speech input. Results show users fnd an abstract feedback method efective and signifcantly more private and secure than a commonly used video feedback method."

      "text": "Speech input enabled devices, such as personal voice assistants, allow users to communicate with computer systems using speech commands. Personal voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, and Cortana can interpret human speech and handle a wide variety of tasks [53, 72]. Research on speech input mainly focused on the recognition of speech [75, 106, 119], language models [7, 17] and voice controlled systems [121]. Clark et al. [29] provides a comprehensive review of the literature on speech-based input and interaction methods. With the recent advances in speech recognition technology [1, 44, 87, 91, 108], today’s voice-based commercial products [23, 48, 62, 116–118, 120] can perform streaming, highaccuracy, low-latency speech recognition [15, 68] to revolutionize human-computer interaction [29]. Recently, He et al. [49] presented an end-to-end speech recognizer for on-device speech recognition using a recurrent neural network, which has been deployed in the default Google keyboard on the fagship Pixel phones. Despite its popularity, studies show privacy and security concerns for the use of personal voice assistants and voice search commands in public places [36, 37, 78, 92]. A survey2 revealed that 39% smartphone users use the built-in voice assistants at home but only 6-14% use these in public [85]. To uphold the privacy and security of users, researchers explored whisper input, which is a variant of speech input with a signifcantly lower energy than normal speech. These works detected whispered speech using a stethoscopic microphone that contacts the skin behind the ear [79], a throat microphone [59], and a non-contact microphone by placing it very close to the front of the narrowly opened mouth [40]. Recently, Amazon included a whisper mode to their personal voice assistant Alexa3. When users whisper to Alexa, it whispers back to them. Some have also incorporated state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to improve the performance of whisper speech recognition [41, 42, 45]. However, whispers with a much lower acoustic power and relatively fat spectrum than regular speech are inherently noise-like, thus are highly susceptible to acoustic interference [76]. Moreover, long-term use of whisper voice might have negative efects on our vocal cords [103]."

      "text": "have been several previous attempts at achieving silent speech communication. Many have explored silent speech enabled input and interaction methods that use diferent sensors (e.g., electromagnetic articulography (EMA) [38, 43, 50], electroencephalogram (EEG) [88], electromyography (EMG) [56–58, 74, 105, 115], ultrasound imaging [31, 32, 39, 43, 50, 54, 55, 61], vibrational sensors of glottal activity [83, 84, 95, 113], speech motor cortex implants [18], and non-audible murmur (NAM) microphone [51, 52, 80]) to recover the speech content produced without vibration of the vocal folds, by detecting tongue, facial, and throat movements. Some have developed intracortical microelectrode Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to predict user’s intended speech information directly from the brain activities involved in the speech production mechanism [24, 30, 89, 111, 112]. Some have also used multimodal imaging systems for speech recognition, focusing mainly on tongue visualization [55]. A recent work developed a wearable interface that places fve EMG sensors above the face to capture the neuromuscular signals for silent speech recognition [60]. Most of these works, however, use invasive, impractical, non-portable setup, impeding their scalability in real-world scenarios."

      "text": "More recently, attempts have been made to enable silent speech communication using video-based recognition, referred to as lip reading [2, 8, 13, 19, 25, 26, 26–28, 86, 109]. For example, a work provided smartphone users access to their phone functionalities through silent speech commands [110]. It used the front camera of a smartphone to capture the motion of the mouth, then recognized the silently spoken commands using deep-learning-based image sequence recognition technology. These works suggest that videobased silent speech input method could be more user friendly and appropriate in private and public settings since it can be used without any wearable devices. It has the potential to facilitate input and interaction on private devices when the hands are not available, as well as on public devices when direct contact is not recommended in times like the current COVID-19 situation. It can also help people with speech disorder, muteness, and blindness to input and interact with computer systems, increasing their access to technologies."

In a recent work, Baier and Burmester [16] explored the social acceptability of speech input, which revealed that location infuences users’ willingness to use the method in public spaces. However, no prior study has explored user attitudes and acceptance of using silent speech input. In a diferent research, Alallah et al.

To investigate users’ perspective, researchers either provided participants with a frst-hand experience using a new technology or showed them video clips on how the technology could potentially be used [3]. Later, participants were asked to consider themselves as users of the technology and express their opinion on using it in diferent contexts. While there are many social acceptability studies conducted from the users’ perspective, less attention has been paid to examine social acceptance from viewers’ standpoints. A few studies investigated social acceptance from the viewers’ perspective where researchers elicited opinions from people watching others using a new technology in diferent contexts. Montero et al. [77] showed that considering viewers viewpoint is important, especially when using the technology in public places, as users’ interactions with the technology might draw bystanders’ (or the viewers’) unwanted attention. Consequently, viewers’ perspective are explored for wearable e-textile interface [93, 94], Augmented Reality (AR) in public space [34], and public interfaces (e.g., public performance act) [96]. Additionally, some studies considered both the users’ and the viewers’ perspectives while evaluating the social acceptance of new technologies, such as gestural interaction on mobile devices [77], head-worn devices [4, 5, 65, 70], data glass [64], and around device input methods [3]. These studies were commonly conducted by examining observers’ impression on watching other people interacting with a technology — either in a real-world setting or in a video. In this paper, we examined the social acceptability of speech and silent speech input from both users’ and viewers’ perspectives."

For instance, they investigated using speech and silent speech input methods that range from noticeable to inconspicuous [24, 38, 56, 61, 84, 110, 121]. Speech or voice input, which is commercially available on smartphones, requires users to make voice commands to send instructions to mobile devices. This input modality is explicit and commonly draws co-located observers’ attention due to the nature of its input visibility – thus can make users feel awkward or uncomfortable with the presence of nearby users. On the other hand, silent speech input, which recognizes speech without requiring users to make acoustic signals, interprets users’ commands on smartphones by tracking tongue and lip movements. This input method is more subtle than the speech input, and used when acoustics is not an option (e.g., speech-impaired people) or it is undesired (e.g., during a confdential conversation or communication in public places). On one hand, using explicit input modalities can convey clear instructions to the devices; however, this form of input might be less socially acceptable due to the visibility to co-located people. On the other hand, subtle inputs are less explicit; however, colocated observers might not readily interpret these commands, making the interaction more acceptable. Therefore, we frst conduct a study to explore the social acceptability of these two input modalities."

Participants commonly respond by indicating how comfortable they were using the method on a 5-point Likert scale – Extremely comfortable, Somewhat comfortable, Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable, Somewhat uncomfortable, and Extremely uncomfortable. Therefore, we used six audiences (i.e., alone, partner, family, friends, colleagues, and strangers) and seven locations (i.e., home, shop, bus or train, pavement or sidewalk, pub or restaurant, museum or library, and workplace) to explore participants’ impression of using the two input methods (i.e., speech and silent speech).

Similar fndings were revealed in a prior work [5], where they suggested that less noticeable input methods (e.g., ring and touchpad) are more socially acceptable than noticeable ones (e.g., hand gestures) to interact with an HMD. The results also show that participants preferred to use silent speech input over speech input. In subjective feedback, participants expressed their interest in using silent speech input as it is more subtle and provide a high degree of privacy and security than the other method. One participant (male, 35–44 years) commented, “I would still feel that I have a high level of privacy when using silent input“. Another participant (female, 35–44 years) wrote, “I prefer whisper or silent because it doesn’t bother others and can be used in quiet places like libraries”."

      "text": "Though the results showed users’ interest in using silent speech input, there are several key questions remain unknown that could infuence their attitude towards using the method. For instance, researchers showed that silent speech input could be prone to high error rates [33, 69, 82, 90]. Consequently, silent speech recognition accuracy could be a key factor in adopting the method. However, little is know of users’ error tolerance level for silent speech input. Additionally, silent speech input recognition on mobile devices depends primarily on capturing users tongue and lip movements via the front camera. Thus, providing appropriate real-time feedback on input recognition is critical for the acceptance of the method. Therefore, in the next two studies, we explore error tolerance and suitable feedback mechanism for silent speech input."

In the study, we injected 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% misrecognition errors. A misrecognition error occurs when the recognizer incorrectly recognizes a word [12], for example, “take a cofee break” (“cofee” was replaced with “tofee”). The total number of misrecognition errors in a condition was calculated using the following equation: (w × e)/100, where w is the total number of words in all presented phrases in the condition and e is the target error rate. We injected errors at word level since both speech and silent speech methods work at either word or phrase level. To inject errors, we randomly replaced a word consisting more than three letters with a similar sounding word, excluding the frst word. To assure that all participants encountered the same errors, we randomly pre-selected a subset of phrases from the MacKenzie and Soukoref [73] set, then used those with the methods in a counterbalanced order.

Before the study, participants were told that the purpose of the study was to compare the performance of multiple speech and silent speech recognition methods that may vary in accuracy rate. The study took place at a campus cafeteria. We picked a public place for the study since its purpose was to investigate whether users were willing to tolerate more errors for the sake of increased privacy and security. Note that the survey results suggested that users are likely to be more conscious about their privacy and security when in public. Upon arrival, we demonstrated the speech and silent speech methods on the smartphone and explained the study procedure to each participant. We then collected their consents. The study started after that, where participants were instructed to enter short English phrases from the MacKenzie and Soukoref [73] set using either speech or silent speech at varying injected error rates. The methods were counterbalanced and the error rates were randomly injected to mitigate any potential learning efects. The interface displayed one phrase at a time. Participants were instructed to tap on the screen when they were done speaking or silently speaking the phrase. They all sat at a table in the cafeteria (Fig. 4). A researcher (the wizard) sat at a nearby table with the server interface launched on a laptop computer. Upon completion of each phrase, she pressed a key to display the recognized phrase and the next phrase on the smartphone. Participants were asked to speak or silently speak a phrase again when the phrase contained a misrecognized word. Upon completion of each condition (method × injected error rate), participants completed a short questionnaire that asked them to rate their willingness to use the examined methods on a 5-point Likert scale. Upon completion of the complete study, they completed the NASA-TLX questionnaire [81] to rate the methods’ perceived workload. We then held a debrief session to explain the study’s actual purpose. A complete study session took about 60 minutes."

Second, to investigate whether users perceive the frequency in which errors occur diferently with diferent feedback methods. For error injection, we used the same approach as the previous study. However, here we maintained a constant 5% error rate over all sessions and injected tracking error rather than misrecognition error. The 5% error rate was chosen as it was found to be an acceptable error rate in various text entry system [6, 9, 11]. A tracking error occurs when the system fails to track the lips because they are out of sight or range, or due to technical issues, resulting in missing words in the fnal text, for example, “take it to the recycling depot” (“recycling” is removed). We injected tracking error since the purpose of visual feedback on a recognition system is usually to inform users that it is receiving the tracking signals. Hence, tracking error is more appropriate to evaluate the efciency of visual feedback than misrecognition error."

Once participant (female, 31 years) commented, “I have privacy concerns with video feedback, I don’t want to see my phone camera on when using apps all the time”. Another participant (male, 27 years) wrote, “In my opinion, the video feedback mode will always gonna be a concern for my privacy and security”. In terms of willingness to use, participants were slightly leaning towards the abstract feedback, but this diference was not statistically signifcant (medium efect size). This is not necessarily a bad thing since it can be interpreted as, users are impartial about the methods, thus using an abstract feedback method is an acceptable design choice. Participants found both methods to be equally reliable (did not compromise accuracy), but interestingly they felt the system with video feedback was slower (statistically not signifcant) although both used the same Wizard-of-Oz setup. We speculate this is because participants were looking at the video while speaking, which increased the mental demand due to information processing, giving them the impression that it was slower. One limitation of these fndings is the lack of generalizability in terms of personality, culture, and ethnic background. Although, the study questionnaire used questions from the SUS questionnaire [22] and custom questions prepared following the Dix et al.

However, without empirical data, it is difcult to come to a conclusion as users’ perception towards using the method might be infuenced by various factors, such as where they are using the method, in front of whom they are using it, and their acceptance towards the errors committed by the methods. The study results confrm that silent speech input is more socially acceptable as it is subtle, more secure, and less attention-seeking than speech input. Moreover, our results afrm that users are willing to accept more recognition errors with silent speech input than speech input. This is primarily due to the fact that the method is more private, secure, and does not trigger feelings of discomfort. Consequently, users expressed their intention to use the method even with a higher rate of errors than speech input. However, they also showed their preference in limiting the error rate within a reasonable threshold (e.g., 5–10%) for both input methods. We also observed that there is a possible linkage between perceived privacy and security and feedback design for silent speech input. Though video feedback provides users with detailed information (e.g., whether lip movements are captured by the camera), participants expressed their concerns about using this feedback method as it may operate in an always-on manner, continually tracking and analyzing lip movements from the camera. These results further confrm users’ strong intention"

      "text": "In this paper, we took a step toward understanding users’ perception about using silent speech input method from social acceptance, error tolerance, and feedback design perspectives. While an in-thewild study would have provided further insights into these issues in more realistic usage contexts, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not an option available to us. Our results encourage a further exploring on these issues in an in-the-wild study. For Study 2 and 3, we recruited participants from a western country which limits the generalizability of the data across diferent culture and ethnic background. We acknowledge that a larger and more diverse sample would have further afrmed the fndings. Additionally, in Study 3, we investigated only one type of abstract feedback (e.g., blinking dot) for silent speech input, leaving out other possible abstract feedback (e.g., sinusoid icons) that could also infuence users’ impression towards silent speech input. Further investigation is needed to identify any diferences or similarities between a wider range of feedback methods. Last but not least, our studies were conducted with Wizard-of-Oz mimicking a mobile silent speech input method. Hence, we were unable to study other technical factors (e.g., silent speech processing delay) that could have afected users’ willingness to use the method. It would be interesting to develop an app to enable silent speech input on mobile devices to perform a longitudinal study examining users’ perception towards the input modality."

      "text": "In this paper, we investigated users’ impression towards using silent speech input method on mobile devices from social acceptance, error tolerance, and feedback design perspectives. In a crowdsourced survey, we found out that in general people preferred using silent speech input over the traditional speech input. We also observed that users were more comfortable using silent speech input in different public and private locations but expressed their concerns about input recognition, privacy, and security issues. Consequently, we conducted a study examining users’ error tolerance with both input methods, where results revealed their willingness to tolerate more errors for the sake of privacy and security. In the fnal study exploring suitable feedback for silent speech input, we observed that users found both a video and an abstract feedback methods efective. Yet, they found the latter to be signifcantly more private and secure than the commonly used video feedback. We learned that designing solutions for silent speech input requires careful consideration of various factors and privacy concerns as well as people’s tolerance towards using it on mobile devices."
