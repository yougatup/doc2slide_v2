    "text": "ABSTRACT Breastfeeding brings benefts for newborns and parents, but can be a challenging process. In this paper, we leverage a mixed-methods approach that builds on the Integrated Behavioural Model (IBM) to explore parents’ perspectives toward breastfeeding along with their lived experiences, and examine the role of technology in this setting. Results of twelve semi-structured interviews and 175 online survey responses suggest generally positive attitudes toward breastfeeding and good theoretical knowledge. This is combined with a complex lived experience of breastfeeding where main challenges are situated in practical, emotional, and environmental/societal aspects, which are currently not sufciently recognised by technology that seeks to support breastfeeding. Building upon our fndings, we present points for refection for the design of technology to support breastfeeding, focusing on the importance of drawing from the lived experience of parents, and ensuring that technology not only casts breastfeeding as an individual but also as a collective efort."

Beyond these issues, the success of breastfeeding is determined by one’s intention to initiate the process [23, 48, 58] and the ability to maintain breastfeeding over time [5, 8, 9, 30, 46, 47, 55]. Here, aspects such as attitudes toward breastfeeding, acknowledgement of the benefts of human milk over formula, norms, and perceived support direct the intention to breastfeed [47, 60]. Likewise, breastfeeding knowledge and skill can have a lasting impact on parents’ decisions to continue to breastfeed, for example, impacting perceived self-efcacy and the ability to deal with practical issues [8]. Here, self-efcacy is related to breastfeeding experience right after the delivery, but also past experience and exposure to breastfeeding [47, 60]. Other stakeholders also play a role as parents’ perception of being supported improves both self-efcacy and intention to breastfeed [47, 64]. Beyond healthcare providers who can ofer professional support, the involvement and support of partners heavily infuence the decision to breastfeed and maintaining the feeding practice [64]. Insight into these barriers and facilitators helps direct the development of inquires to probe the lived experience of infant feeding."

Researchers in the HCI community have examined the potential of technology to address challenges for breastfeeding parents at a pragmatic level and to improve the understanding of the feeding process. Regarding pragmatic support, prior work investigated the design implications for technology to tackle logistic and environmental barriers to breastfeeding. For example, through the Feed Finder app that allows breastfeeding parents to fnd and review public breastfeeding places [6], the Milk Matters app that facilitates the logistics of breast milk donation [67], the Feedpal chatbot that provides answers to concerns about the feeding process [70], and through participatory design that explores desirable breast pump designs [22]. Prior work also looked into the opportunity to leverage playful technology to improve the understanding of breastfeeding among relevant stakeholders [32]. Beyond breastfeeding, the HCI research community has also investigated technology design for parenthood more broadly. For example, existing work provides an investigation into peer support seeking among pregnant women [35], the role of ICT in supporting new mothers [33] and the disclosure of pregnancy loss on social media [4]. Here, prior work reveals an extensive use of technology among parents in exploring their (new) identity, reassurance, and emotional support from peers, hence, suggesting future research should focus on community eforts to support parenthood. While these studies illustrate the opportunity for technology design to support parenthood and breastfeeding, no structured analysis of its potential in supporting breastfeeding has been carried out to date. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the role of technology to support breastfeeding more broadly through an inquiry into parents’ lived experiences of breastfeeding across the feeding journey from antenatal to postnatal stages."

Compared to relevant models such as the Information-Motivation Behavioural skills model [28], the Self-Determination Theory [62], and the Social-Cognitive Theory [7], the IBM is more complete and rigorous as it focuses not only on factors that infuence the intention to breastfeed but also the factors that enable parents to proceed. Although models like the Health Belief Model [61] and the Transtheoretical Model [57] also describe the driving forces behind certain health behaviours, they are less suitable here as they tend to characterise feeding options other than breastfeeding as an unhealthy behaviour that should be altered. The relevance of the IBM allows us to fully capture motives to breastfeed (or bottle feed) among parents and parents-to-be, which will, in turn, indicate design implications for breastfeeding technology. The model has been extensively used to understand the behaviour of HIV/AID preventions [37], to predict high-risk drinking behaviours [13], and to identify the roles and design goals of technologies for wheelchair users [45]."

Negative perspectives were related to the image of breastfeeding, e.g., “I still have the image of the breastfeeding mom are more like the hippy style. [. . . ] I couldn’t imagine myself doing it; [. . . ] I was not considered doing the pumping; that’s too cow like” (P8, bottle feeding parent) and concerns around pain and difculty, e.g., “I’ll not go through hell to give the breastfeeding” (P12, expecting parent). Interestingly, participants regarded bottle feeding as a luxury option, but a better way to share parental responsibility. For many, it was a fallback option if breastfeeding failed. Attitudes of partners of breastfeeding parents were more neutral. While interviews revealed that partners sought to be supportive (e.g., providing encouragement or taking over chores to relieve the breastfeeding parent), we observed one instance where the partner was in favour of bottle feeding, with the breastfeeding partner stating “To him, the only way to fx [problems with breastfeeding] is to bottle feed” (P2)."

Likewise, healthcare professionals and hospital environments were seen as a source of pressure, and participants reported negative experiences on social media, referring to these stakeholders as the “breastfeeding mafa”. Here, social media appeared to increase pressure rather than alleviate it, e.g., “[...] a few young mothers that I follow on Instagram or on youtube [...] switched to bottle, the comments are so cruel and mean that you really feel that hmm, wow it’s not ok to give a bottle” (P8). This notion was supported by healthcare professionals, who suggested that parents associate guilt with bottle feeding even when there was a medical indication for switching from breastfeeding: “But if I say like ok, bottle feeding, they feel directly guilty.” (P7, midwife).

Personal agency – consisting of perceived control and self-efcacy construct – has a strong presence in our data, with instances predominantly addressing the relationship between infant feeding, agency, and implications of the lack thereof. Positive instances of perceived control were mainly refected in the convenience associated with each of the feeding modes: most participants found breastfeeding a convenient option, e.g., “you don’t have to carry a lot of stuf with you” (P1) and “you always have it with you, and it is always at the right temperature” (P3). Bottle feeding parents highlighted how sharing parental responsibility contributed to perceived control, suggesting that it meant they would not have to “lock myself in the house to not coming out anymore” (P12). This was also refected in a perceived lack of agency expressed by breastfeeding parents, e.g., “[the baby] is kind of tied up to me, daddy cannot take care of him” (P1). Interestingly, one partner expressed jealousy over their inability to breastfeed their child, suggesting that they felt “jealous that I will never be able to experience towards my children what my wife experiences” (P5). Feeding modes also had an impact on self-efcacy. Here, bottle feeding parents felt more certain of their routines, with one participant suggesting that “the baby comes with instructions” (P8), whereas milk supply management afected the perceived self-efcacy of breastfeeding parents and caused parents to stop breastfeeding (P2). Generally, this theme suggests that continuously responding to the needs of the baby reduced parents’ personal agency, and that breastfeeding had more challenging implications in terms of parental lifestyle and mothers’ perceived control in particular."

With respect to breastfeeding information, some participants commented that materials idealised the image of breastfeeding while insufciently addressing potential challenges and coping strategies (P2, P6). Participants also commented that maternal education dismissed bottle feeding (P5, P6).

      "text": "Managing the Feeding Process. Parents generally described their infant feeding journey as a mission to satisfy their child’s needs while seeking to maintain their own health and comfort. This includes the ad-hoc development of coping strategies when feeding becomes challenging. Participants noted that they had to embrace the fact that “every baby is diferent” (P5) and that you “can’t be for 100% prepared” (P12). To adapt to the unpredictability of breastfeeding, most participants combined preemptive and responsive strategies. Preemptively, parents reported trying to “be as realistic as possible not to be disappointed” (P12) and avoid having “a fxed idea in your head about I want to do this for this long or I want it like this”. Parents’ responses to unforeseen challenges are strongly linked with technology use. Some parents turned to online communities to relate to others’ stories of breastfeeding experiences and to see how other people cope with challenges (P4), or follow up on other people’s choice of feeding practice after encountering similar challenges (P2). Web searches regarding specifc issues (rather than general breastfeeding information) also played an important role. Participants reported using a range of technology platforms to log their feeding routines in the early days, e.g., “Google home [...] confgured that so it put on an excel sheet” (P1) and mobile apps (P1, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8), helping them to understand their feeding habits, to establish new routines, and also ofered reassurance that their child was well-fed."

This theme refects the emotional challenges that parents experienced throughout the feeding journey that often oscillates between moments of intimacy and wonder, and exhaustion and frustration. Breastfeeding participants reported instances of intimacy, and described feeling “amazed” (P3, P5) and “special” (P7, P6). Partners sometimes ofered a more nuanced perspective, with one father suggesting that “[his partner breastfeeding his child] is one of the most beautiful processes that I witnessed in person, but it is also rough and painful” (P5). Practically, negative emotions were often related to physical discomfort. For example, breastfeeding was described as “difcult”, “not enjoyable” and “frustrating” due to unexpected challenges (P6, P2). Likewise, breastfeeding parents expressed conficting feelings about the feeding relationship with their child, often linked to their own exhaustion, e.g., “[...] at night, it would be easier if she would fnd her comfort in something else” (P3) and “but yeah, 3 in the morning, it’s a chore, [smiled]” (P8). We also observed instances where bottle feeding parents expressed jealousy at parents who did succeed in breastfeeding, and partners who, as a result of breastfeeding felt less involved and experienced negative emotions: \"[...] I do feel in a way jealous that I will never be able to experience towards my children what my wife experiences [...]” (P5) and \"I think that as a father it’s, you’re sort of at the sideline.\" (P4). Some participants reported feeling emotionally burdened by these experiences (P3, P2) and ultimately stopped breastfeeding because of them (P2, P6). However, the transition to bottle feeding also created challenges. For instance, one participant noted that it was “so emotional, it was a really hard decision to make, to stop, in my time, it was a good decision, but it was really hard to make that decision” (P2) and “I felt guilty, although I know I shouldn’t feel that way, but I did.” (P6). The end of the breastfeeding journey also took an unexpected emotional toll on some breastfeeding parents, feeling emotional about releasing the bond they had built with their child."

However, some participants felt that practical issues (e.g., establishing habits, addressing unexpected challenges, and navigating environmental challenges) were insuffciently addressed by breastfeeding education, and resulted in a mismatch between their expectations and the lived experience of breastfeeding. Here, parents highlighted the importance of becoming a resilient infant feeder who has the practical resources to dynamically tackle unexpected challenges (e.g., extensively consulting online resources to address individual feeding problems). Likewise, fndings suggest that breastfeeding can be emotionally challenging due to physical demands, and that parents experience feelings of loss or guilt when breastfeeding comes to a (sometimes earlier than planned) end. Finally, attitudes toward technology and breastfeeding were positive in the context of practical support (e.g., to track feeds); however, participants expressed concerns about educational systems with respect to the quality of content regarding factual accuracy and adequate representation of challenges. Likewise, the idea of technology directly linked with children sparked privacy concerns. Generally, parents predominantly viewed technology as a tool to manage the feeding process particularly in the early stages of breastfeeding, with its importance dwindling as they grew more confdent."

(2) Examination of the IBM constructs using 5-point Likert scales (attitude, perceived norm, personal agency, knowledge and skill, environmental constraints, salience, habit) with items such as \"I don’t feel very comfortable seeing people breastfeed in front of me\" (Attitude), \"I think I’m/my partner is skilful enough to breastfeed\" (Knowledge), \"I think breastfeeding is convenient\" (Personal agency), and \"I think breastfeeding is not as crucial as advertised\" (Salience). (3) Exploration of parents’ lived infant feeding experience, with questions polling for their practical and emotional experience of the feeding process, e.g., \"I fnd it difcult to anticipate what breastfeeding would be like\", and \"I think breastfeeding gives an opportunity to have an intimate parent-child moment\". (4) Inquiry into technology use and perspective towards technology in infant feeding space. Sample questions include: \"I think technology can’t convey a realistic image of breastfeeding.\" and \"Please list the technology that you have used in the context of infant feeding\". The survey included a combination of question types, with most statements to be rated on 5-points Likert scales, multiple-choice questions with an optional input feld, and open questions. Depending on their role in the infant feeding process, participants received an adapted set of questions refecting their own situation (breastfeeding parents, parents who bottle feed with formula, partners, and parents-to-be). On average, each participant would see 94 questions. Please refer to the supplementary materials for the full survey."

Regardless of feeding mode, external factors such as social norms and environment are not always perceived as openly supportive toward breastfeeding, leaving room for improvement. In terms of becoming a resilient infant feeder, fndings support the notion that breastfeeding is a complex and surprisingly challenging process that threatens perceived autonomy particularly in the beginning of the feeding relationship. In contrast to interview fndings, survey respondents did not report pressure to breastfeed from family and friends, but were aware of perspectives of healthcare professionals as well as wider expectations of society on whether, how and where to breastfeed.

Our results highlight that the lived experience of breastfeeding is messier than what parents anticipate. In particular, parents highlighted the impact of practical and emotional challenges throughout the feeding journey, e.g., having to make ad-hoc adjustments to the feeding process in response to problems, or having to embrace the lack of routine that can come with breastfeeding. Additionally, our results highlight that not all factors that infuence the lived experience reside within the breastfeeding parent, but are associated with their environment (e.g., wider society or the built environment). This suggests that technology directly addressing parents needs to embrace and adequately refect the complexities of breastfeeding to facilitate realistic expectation setting at the prenatal stage, and fexible support throughout the feeding process. However, rather than solely focusing on parents, our fndings suggest that there also is potential for technology interventions targeting wider society, e.g., to raise awareness of breastfeeding parents’ needs and to further normalise breastfeeding."

Participants were cautiously optimistic about the potential of technology to support breastfeeding, suggesting that they would be willing to engage with technology-based support (or already do so). However, the participants were sceptical about the potential of technology in providing practical support. Considering the breastfeeding journey, it is important to recognise changing parental needs, e.g., the wide adoption of tracking technology is viewed as trivial in later postnatal stages once a feeding routine has been established. Furthermore, concerns about the credibility of information highlight the delicate nature of infant feeding, suggesting demand for supporting interventions endorsed by organisations and policymakers."

For systems targeting parents in the prenatal stages, this means that choice of technology is not as important as the fact that content needs to be carefully crafted so that it accurately conveys the complexity of lived breastfeeding experiences (without discouraging breastfeeding). We speculate that interactive simulations might be used to portray the lived experience, e.g., by means of mobile applications that ofer interactive insights into breastfeeding, or games as suggested by [32]. For systems to be used in the postnatal period, the focus should be on supporting parental resilience. Here, systems should provide tailored and reliable information on potential challenges; designers need to ensure that the content is aligned with ofcial guidelines and endorsed by trustworthy authorities. In terms of deployment platform, our data suggests that easily accessible platforms such as mobile apps or websites are most suited for a period during which parents typically have few hands to spare. However, we would also like to note that there are issues that cannot (and should not) be addressed through technology (e.g., if a parent experiences serious challenges in the breastfeeding process). Here, access to human support is vital, and technology needs to move into the background (e.g., serving as a platform to connect relevant parties)."

Likewise, technology in this space predominantly focuses on mothers [65], and even in instances where negative implications of societal and environmental aspects are recognised, burden is still placed on the breastfeeding parent (e.g., in the application FeedFinder [6] that helps breastfeeding parents identify breastfeeding-friendly spaces). While an efective workaround in the short term, such systems run the risk of distracting from the fact that breastfeeding support should be a collective efort, where family and wider society also carry responsibility [56]. Therefore, technology needs to adopt a broader perspective on breastfeeding support, and not only address the breastfeeding parent, but also involve partners and their families along with wider society in an"

In terms of opportunities for technology to support this change, we see potential in systems that can help other parties understand the lived experience of breastfeeding, and systems that highlight the needs of breastfeeding parents. For example, text message or notifcation systems that have typically been used to target breastfeeding mothers could also be leveraged to encourage partners and family members to actively get involved and help breastfeeding persons. Beyond the involvement of immediate family, there is an opportunity to develop systems that communicate requirements for breastfeeding-friendly spaces to policy makers, architects, and employers, allowing them to refect on their design choices through the lens of breastfeeding parents. For example, we envision a VR simulation that immerses the stakeholders in a breastfeeding (or milk expression) experience taking place in the model of an ofce building. Likewise, there is potential to leverage technology to normalise breastfeeding in wider society, increasing the awareness of the feeding process and parents’ right to public breastfeeding. Thereby, we hope that technology can support a shift from individual to collective responsibility for successful breastfeeding, rather than reinforcing existing structures that place the burden on the breastfeeding parent."

Most importantly, we would like to refect on the participant samples that we drew for the online survey in particular. Many respondents were successful longer-term breastfeeding parents rather than parents who at some point decided to bottle feed. The sample of bottle feeding parents and responses from partners were more limited. In the interview study, we did not specifcally investigate the role of lactation consultants as this service is frequently provided by midwives in the region where our work was carried out. However, in other geographical regions, exploring their role in particular is important due to the support they provide to new parents. While these limitations do not limit the implications of our fndings for the group of breastfeeding parents, a further exploration of the other groups along with an examination of breastfeeding in additional countries might provide valuable further insights into barriers toward breastfeeding and how to better support parents. In addition, our research built on technology participants already used rather than the introduction and discussion of new artefacts, and our choice on the theoretical model does not refect the impact of individuals’ feeding experience on breastfeeding determinants. Likewise, our work does not especially investigate the impact of the child’s age and the maturity of feeding relationship on the feeding experience. In the future, such an investigation could supplement our work, as our initial fndings already suggest that the perception of breastfeeding and support needs change across the feeding journey."
