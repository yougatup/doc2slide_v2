    "text": "ABSTRACT Drones are rapidly populating human spaces, yet little is known about how these fying robots are perceived and understood by humans. Recent works suggested that their acceptance is predicated upon their sociability. This paper explores the use of facial expressions to represent emotions on social drones. We leveraged design practices from ground robotics and created a set of rendered robotic faces that convey basic emotions. We evaluated individuals’ response to these emotional facial expressions on drones in two empirical studies (N = 98, N = 98). Our results demonstrate that"

      "text": "Over the last few years, small-size drones have become increasingly popular, being used in a wide range of applications from photo and videography to deliveries and search and rescue [78]. Early works on collocated Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) observed that people interacted with the drone as with a person or an animal [18, 24]. Recently, researchers have highlighted novel opportunities created by social drones that operate in human spaces and can support people in their daily lives, such as when exercising [57], to get home safely [43], as a navigational aid [2, 14, 20], and even as a personal companion [41, 45]. Yet, designing a social drone [7] is not trivial, and we are only at the beginning of understanding which factors infuence people’s perception of drones [81]. However, the literature on interacting with ground robots is rich and teaches us that social robots can communicate with people using emotions and expressive behaviors designed around features such as: facial expression, posture, gesture, and voice [10]. This results in interactions that are informative, “human-like”, and pleasant [32]. Unfortunately, fndings from ground robotics cannot be directly translated into drones [81]. For instance, prior work showed that robots with eyes and no mouth are perceived as unfriendly [40], while drones with equivalent facial features are perceived as likable and warm [70]."

Thus, the use of facial expressions in social drones might have a potential to, not only communicate the drone’s state, but also to elicit particular reactions and behaviors from a user."

      "text": "The enriching efects of integrating convincing emotions into nonhuman agents has been extensively researched in the robotics domain [5, 12, 75]. Eyssel et al. [29] showed that users tend to perceive the interaction with an emotional robot as more pleasant, feel closer to it, and ascribe human attributes to it, such as intentionality. Attribution of intentions, in turn, can foster feelings of social connection, empathy, and prosociality [44, 80]. Furthermore, there is evidence that robots’ abilities to display emotions contribute, not only to their overall perceived relatability and sociability, but also to the efectiveness of their communication with a user. Leite et al. [50] found that when a robot acts as a game companion, their emotional behavior can help users better understand the game. In their recent work, Fischer et al. [31] showed that people expect robots to express emotions reactively, similarly to the conventionally required display of emotions between humans [73]. Indeed, we know from the research on human-human communication that displaying emotions has crucial communicative and social functions [33, 46], such as forming guidelines for future behavior to avoid or elicit emotional outcomes [6]. Research showed that afective robots similarly induce people to make sense of their intentions to guide human behaviors [29, 66]. The communicative and social functions of displaying emotions motivates the interest in the exploration of its application to the design of social drones [7, 19]. In particular, it was recently argued that, in human spaces, drones need to present social features [7]. The researchers name the intuitive comprehension of drones’ intentions – to what degree people are able to interpret intentions that the drone is trying to convey via the interaction – as one of the major human-centered concerns in the design of social drones. One major challenge is then to investigate how to appropriately embed the display of emotions into the interaction design of social drones, including how to display emotions and what emotions are reasonable to display."

      "text": "In both human-human and human-robot communication, the display of emotions occurs though external, i.e., visible and audible, behavioral manifestations. Such manifestations can take diverse forms [46], such as verbal and non-verbal elements of language, gesture, posture, and gaze. Correspondingly, in robotics, researchers have explored diverse ways to convey emotions. For instance, there is a large body of work on afective perceptions of robots’ body movements, sound and color, and diverse combinations of these elements [37, 38, 52]. Furthermore, researchers found that people’s ability to anthropomorphize objects [23, 30, 68] provides a supporting mechanism in the design of social robots, allowing to translate some of the social conventions, expectations, and perception mechanisms from human-human to human-robot contexts [22, 47, 48]. Drones, however, because of their fight capability tend to be nonanthropomorphic in nature, and as such, their design difers from their ground counterparts [81]."

[74] proposed expressive fights following the Laban Efort System [60] and showed that people can diferentiate between drone states along the valence and arousal dimensions. Cauchard et al. [19] later defned an emotional model space for drones and showed that humans can accurately associate a drone’s movements and behavior to an emotional state corresponding to a personality model. Arroyo et al. [1] investigated other means to convey a drone’s emotional state using head movement, eye color, and the propellers’ noise. They demonstrated that diferent states of these elements are being selectively associated with positive, negative, and neutral emotions. Additional eforts have been conducted towards establishing design recommendations for social drones, suggesting the suitability of faces [41] that could convey friendly features [84], such as Kim et al. [45] who further proposed that an ideal companion drone should present “adorability” features. Wojciechowska et al. [81] quantifed how physical properties, such as facial features, infuence people’s perception of drones, such as eyes, which increase perceived friendliness, likeability, and a person’s willingness to interact with the drone. Although these works did not investigate emotional expression per se, they open the space to the use of facial features on drones."

In affective robotics, while facial expressions received much attention [4, 11, 15], the consensus on their recognition and interpretation is still lacking [76]. Prior works further highlighted that the accuracy of emotion recognition for artifcial emotions difer across robot faces’ designs [11, 17] and that it might depend on the displayed intensity of the emotion [4]. Moreover, it is unclear how fndings from afective ground robotics apply to drones given that there is evidence that robots with diferent shapes trigger diferent emotions in humans [39], and given that drones tend to be non-anthropomorphic in nature [81]."

Several approaches exist to the design of facial expressions to communicate emotions [40, 66]. Some artifcial faces attempt to mimic the look of the human face, e.g., by using the Delsarte’s code of facial expressions [15] or by establishing pseudo-facial expressions by “cloning” real human expressions onto an avatar [85]. Others choose to develop animal-like designs [11, 76] or cartoon-like facial expressions [4] inspired by principles of animations [67], often minimizing the amount of facial elements [66]. Our design used a cartoon-like 2D format since such faces led to higher emotion recognition compared to photo-realistic faces in prior work [42, 86], and to minimize the risk of falling into the uncanny valley [54], which can trigger undesired emotional reaction [53, 56]."

Our next step was to identify the minimal set of features required to convey the chosen set of emotions. We used the well-established Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [26], which documents single muscle units required to create universally recognizable basic emotions (Table 1). This provided us with the necessary systematical approach needed for creating emotional facial expressions for drones. Furthermore, we chose to include pupils, as rendered robot faces without pupils are perceived negatively [40]. Our fnal resulting set included: eyes, eyebrows, pupils, and mouth.

We presented the developed set of faces (Figure 2) on a screen display embedded on the DJI Phantom 3 body2. Since design elements have been demonstrated to afect drone perception, and to avoid potential biases in emotion perceptions [62], the body was chosen for its average scores (e.g., on friendliness) in a prior perception study [81]. In Study I, we presented 18 stimuli images (6 emotions × 3 intensities) each displaying one of the developed facial expressions on the drone’s body (e.g., Figure 1 left). In Study II, the drone was presented in 16.6 seconds video clips (e.g., Figure 3). The drone was shown approaching in a straight line for 10 seconds. While the drone moved, its face displayed a neutral expression. Once stopped, its face changed from neutral to low, medium, and high intensity of emotion (in 600 ms). We used the developed set of faces (Figure 2) as key-frames and blended them in the Unity3 game-engine to create the animated facial expressions. After reaching high intensity, the drone remained on display for an additional 6 seconds. The chosen speed, distance, and movement of the drone are based on the literature on comfortable approach [82]. In total, Study II included fve video stimuli, one per emotion of: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Surprise. Disgust was omitted based on low accuracy results from Study I."

For Study I, we calculated the proportion of how often images belonging to an emotion category were associated with that category (e.g., images: serenity, joy, and ecstasy; participant’s choice: serenity or joy or ecstasy) (see Section 5.2.1). In addition, we calculated the percentages of how often participants selected both the correct emotion category and intensity (e.g., image: serenity; participant’s choice: serenity) and how often they selected the wrong emotion category or the correct emotion category but wrong intensity (e.g., image: serenity; participant’s choice: apprehension) for each of the 18 images of drones (see Section 5.3.1). Two resulting confusion matrices were computed, one for emotion category recognition, and one for emotion intensity label. For each confusion matrix, we analyzed whether the emotion/intensity were selected above random choice. To test whether the participants’ best-choice answers were signifcantly above random choice, we used a binomial test for choosing both the correct emotion intensity label (random choice = 1/18) and the correct emotion category (random choice = 1/6). We used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control false discovery rates (FDR) and thus the proportion of Type I errors. When more than one emotion intensity, or emotion category, was signifcantly above random choice for a stimulus, we additionally tested whether the number of best-choice answers difered signifcantly from each other (χ2-goodness of ft test). We used the same statistical procedure to analyze emotion classifcation accuracy in Study II."

The aim was to quantify diferences in participants’ emotional responses after seeing a video of a drone with one of the fve emotions (emotional condition) as compared with a drone displaying a neutral expression (baseline). This study design led to paired samples, as all participants were exposed to the baseline, as well as to all emotional stimuli. In DSMs, the variance of the comparison condition (i.e., emotional condition) is decomposed onto baseline (i.e., neutral condition) variance and diference to the baseline. Variance decomposition is achieved by model constraints, specifcally on the regression weights of the baseline and the diference score predicting the comparison condition (fxed to 1). Additionally, the residual variance of the comparison condition is being constrained to 0. All fve emotions were included in DSMs ftted separately for Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. Thus, each DSM contained fve diference scores (emotional vs. neutral condition), which allowed estimating sample average diferences in ratings of emotional as compared to neutral drones, as well as individual diferences therein."

For instance, the loathing (Disgust high intensity) image was incorrectly labeled as grief (Sadness high intensity) and as rage (Anger high intensity) in a signifcant amount of cases (14% and 15% respectively). Our results indicated that the recognition rates of all low and high intensities were signifcantly higher when participants could perceive all images at once (Task 2 compared to Task 1), except for the Anger emotion category. This is evidence that individuals can recognize and distinguish between emotion intensities based on facial expressions on a drone."

These included trembling, gasping, cowering in fear, feeing when it was scared, gritting its teeth in anger, striking out in frustration, and starting a fght to beat someone up. Participants also acknowledged the fying capability of the drone: “the drone is feeling fear about something it has to do, and it doesn’t want to do it. Maybe doesn’t want to fy high” (S98) and even imagined that the drone could be afraid because “the fight must have gone wrong” (D97). • Perceived Flying Speed □ Participants mentioned the fying speed of the drone in dynamic stimuli as related to its emotional state. This was a surprising fnding since the displayed speed was constant for all emotions. We found, for instance, that some participants perceived the speed as being slow when the drone looked sad “He seems to be slow and down hearted” (D2), “The expression was negative. It moved very slowly as well” (D94). In contrast, the fying speed was occasionally perceived as fast, such as when the drone was angry “Its rotors even seemed to spin faster the madder it got” (D29), “It seemed to moving slowly and then pick up speed before landing, as if something just made it [angry]” (D87). • Expectations □ Participants expressed various expectations around the drone’s emotional state “It seems kind of strange that a drone would be sad” (D58), “What would be the point? To feel bad emotions at the hand of an AI system? I think not. I am the one in control in this situation” (D10). For some, facial expressions on drones were almost surprising and rather positive “I think the drone’s reaction was cute. I wasn’t expecting that. I’m curious [about] what the drone fnd[s] surprising about my presence” (D78). We also found preferences and concerns around the emotional state of the drone: “I am not sure I would like a drone that feels fear” (D45), “It should always make a happy face by default” (D13). Interestingly, some people actively recalled that it is a drone they are facing when describing their thoughts: “He brought out the instinct in me to comfort him.

For some, the drone can develop sympathy and antipathy for humans (“I don’t trust it at all. I’m a good person, and he just thinks I’m terrible” (D98). The drone was described as capable of creating deep bonds with others, feeling complex emotions of love and hate (e.g., “they may grieving a loss of a loved one” (S32). However, participants did not uniformly ascribed the same level of capabilities to the drone, leaving some participants wondering what the drone’s abilities actually are: “I felt concerned with what abilities it would have to be able to harm me” (D74)."

However, Disgust showed poor recognition rates in static and was not further investigated in dynamic stimuli. Finally, while Fear could be well recognized in static stimuli, its recognition rate dropped by 19% in dynamic stimuli. We found that Disgust was more often associated with expressions of Sadness; and Fear was occasionally associated with Disgust or Sadness (in dynamic stimuli). We suggest two main factors that could have contributed to this ambiguity. The frst one is the perceived legitimacy of the emotion in human-drone interaction, where the participants may not have envisioned this emotion as applicable to a drone. For example, participants made comments such as “I think it looks a little weird, seeing a drone with a scared expression”, “It would have to be a fake fear as robot’s do not feel emotion”. Another potential contributing factor is the design of the facial expressions. Our choice of facial features did not include a nose into the drone’s face, while it is included for Disgust in FACS [26] (see Table 1). Similarly, the recognition of Disgust as Sadness may result from the squeezed eye design that one participant referred to as if the drone had “been crying for a while”. This suggests that future face designs should reconsider the shape of the eyes and potentially add a nose in the facial expression of Disgust. However, we believe that the constructed facial expression of Fear can be used for future designs."

The perception of the drone’s state as an emotionally charged feedback to participants’ actions suggests that some interpersonal mechanisms in human-human communication persist for HDI (e.g., seeking for harmonic reciprocal relationships with drones). These efects can become a powerful mechanism to shape human-drone interactions, where for example, the drone’s expressions of emotions can serve to trigger behavior change, mediate human-human relationships, and be used in the development of novel emotional support systems [6, 19, 63]. For example, the drone’s emotional state could be used to prompt feelings of Joy during difcult times or feelings of Fear to notify of immediate threats and danger."

Both in this work and prior works, participants associated drone’s intentions to, respectively, facial expressions and fying behavior. This opens an exciting opportunity to facilitate better emotion recognition and prompt the attribution of intentions and personality to a social drone, by combining bodily and facial expressions of emotions. Interestingly, the notion of participants developing narratives to make sense of the drone’s state was also found in bodily expressions [74], such as participants mentioning that the drone was happy to see them.

Prior work showed that empathy can be fostered, not only by the facial display of emotion, but also through kinesthesia in humanhuman interactions [8]. Given the similarities highlighted earlier in this discussion between human-human and human-drone interaction, we ponder on the role of the drone’s movement in fostering empathy. Interestingly, recent works investigated collocated HDI using bodily expressions of both people and drones acting in synchrony [28, 49]. In terms of interaction design, this means that empathy and synchrony in HDI can be achieved both with and without elements of anthropomorphism (e.g., facial features). This raises the question of how much interpretation we want to keep open when we interact with social drones, and how our interpretation of the drone is shaped through its bodily and facial expressions. Prior work suggested that a tempered anthropomorphism [72] can be an exciting element for art [28] and can enrich freedom for the interpretation of a drone’s bodily expressions. This opens interesting avenues for future research in understanding the role of anthropomorphism in HDI."

At times, this empathetic reaction brings in an infantilizing response, such as comparing the drone to a child who needs its mother’s comfort. Interestingly, socially undesirable emotional states of a drone, such as Anger, can lead to people feeling combative or frightened.

Correspondingly, we suggest that the comparison of the participants’ reactions to static and dynamic stimuli allows to elicit richer and more contextualized data in investigating the perceived emotional expressions in drones.

These methodologies are well-established in the literature [11, 40, 81], highly scalable, reproducible, and safe [82]. Yet, they present limitations as there will be additional factors afecting people’s perception when exposed to a real drone (e.g., noise and wind generated). As prior work has shown that a drone’s movements and behaviors can be used to convey emotions [19, 74], future work is needed to investigate the perception of facial expressions of drones with diferent fight paths and behaviors, and to fully understand whether some modalities are more persuasive in communicating emotions than others. Finally, future work should further investigate the use of drone facial expressions in context, to fully assess the appropriateness of emotional expressions in diferent scenarios of use (e.g., delivery vs. law enforcement vs. sports)."

We designed a set of rendered robotic faces using a minimal number of facial features to represent basic emotions. In two user studies, we showed that people can recognize fve basic emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Surprise on drones, as well as discriminate between diferent emotion intensities. We found that beyond recognition, people interpret the drone’s emotions and create narratives around the drone’s state. In our work, participants were further afected by the drone and displayed diferent responses, including empathy, depending on the valence of the drone’s emotion. We conclude with design and methodological recommendations for future research into social drones. This work contributes to the growing body of work on factors contributing to the acceptability of drones in human spaces."
