    "text": "ABSTRACT Studies show that users do not reliably click more often on headlines classifed as clickbait by automated classifers. Is this because the linguistic criteria (e.g., use of lists or questions) emphasized by the classifers are not psychologically relevant in attracting interest, or because their classifcations are confounded by other unknown factors associated with assumptions of the classifers? We address these possibilities with three studies—a quasi-experiment using headlines classifed as clickbait by three machine-learning models (Study 1), a controlled experiment varying the headline of an identical news story to contain only one clickbait characteristic (Study 2), and a computational analysis of four classifers using real-world sharing data (Study 3). Studies 1 and 2 revealed that clickbait did not generate more curiosity than non-clickbait. Study 3 revealed that while some headlines generate more engagement, the detectors agreed on a classifcation only 47% of the time, raising fundamental questions about their validity."

      "text": "Click-through is the currency of the modern Internet, with content creators striving to garner clicks by baiting users. As a result, we are bombarded daily with a plethora of clickbait, or headlines designed to persuade users to click on them by evoking curiosity and intrigue [1, 2, 6, 36, 40]. Clickbait media used to be associated with low quality and often misleading articles from unreliable sources (e.g., conspiracy, junk science, and satire sites) [7, 28, 36], but increasingly, respectable news outlets of established mainstream media have resorted to these strategies as well in order to gain user attention in a crowded information space [36, 38]. Because clickbait is often associated with scams and misinformation, many argue that articles utilizing clickbait should be detected and demoted or downranked in news aggregators [1], with extensive eforts in the academic community devoted to building algorithms for automatic detection of clickbait. This is exemplifed by the 2017 Clickbait Challenge where teams of scholars worked on clickbait detection solutions to automatically detect this potentially malicious content [34]. But, are clickbait headlines clickbaity? Do users actually click more on clickbait? Literature across diferent felds show mixed results. On the one hand, research reveals a clear user preference toward clickbait content [36, 44]. However, other research reveals that this is not always the case [29, 30, 37]. There are a few possible reasons for the conficting fndings. First, it is possible that the diferences derive from the distinct operationalizations of clickbait, with each study utilizing diferent characteristics of clickbait to study its efects. For example, two studies [29, 37] tested two styles or characteristics of clickbait—forward-referencing (akin to the “wh” characteristic in the present study, (i.e., who, what, where, when, why) and questions (i.e., headlines that ask a question), and compared user engagement and perceptions between these two styles and non-clickbait headlines. In Scacco and Muddiman [37], users engaged more with nonclickbait compared to either of the two clickbait styles. In Molyneux and Coddington [29], the question headline was perceived as lower quality than the non-clickbait headline, although the efects were small. On the other hand, Chakraborty [6] and Rony and colleagues [36] employed several characteristics of clickbait, including questions like in Scacco and Muddiman [37] and Molyneux and Coddington [29], but also other characteristics such as listicles, demonstrative adjectives and hyperboles. Likewise, Venneti and Alam [44] utilized several linguistic characteristics in their study, such as the"

Contrary to Scacco and Muddiman [37] and Molyneux and Coddington [29], Rony and colleagues [36] and Venneti and Alam [44] found that, on average, clickbait received more engagement than non-clickbait. The diference in the characteristics used to defne clickbait among these studies suggests that the conficting fndings might be because some characteristics of clickbait might be more successful than others at generating engagement. Initial evidence of this possibility is revealed in Lockwood’s study [24]. The author’s analysis of headlines of academic articles revealed that while positive framing and arousing framing increased attention to an academic article, framing the title as a question made no diference, and utilizing wordplay negatively infuenced attention."

      "text": "A second possibility for the mixed results of the efects of clickbait found in the literature could be the diferent methodological approaches to study clickbait engagement. Notably, past studies conducted using experimental designs and content analysis [29, 37] fnd that non-clickbait is more engaging than clickbait. Studies using automatic detection [36, 44] reveal the opposite pattern. While it is possible that the null results from experimental studies is due to the low external validity of the method, which does not allow participants to interact with headlines as they normally would during their regular browsing, it is also possible that the engagement captured through computational methods do not represent engagement with clickbait per se, but third variables embedded in the assumptions of each clickbait detector. For example, while some computational models are trained with data labeled as clickbait (or non-clickbait) by human coders (see [6] for example), other models utilize source assumptions for labeling of data (see [26] for example). This represents a fundamental diference in the conceptual defnition and understanding of clickbait. Likewise, classifcation systems to detect clickbait are built using diferent machine learning approaches and techniques. For example, while some detectors are built using traditional machine learning (Naïve Bayes) [13], others utilize more complex deep learning models [36]. The distinct assumptions of classifcation systems are refected in the manner in which their training data are coded (manual coding compared to source assumption), the type of machine learning model employed, and so on, thereby resulting in systems that, although accurate, classify clickbait using their unique idiosyncratic criteria. Such diversity in assumptions and approaches used by automated clickbait detectors raise important questions about the validity of such systems."

For this purpose, we conducted two experimental studies involving human subjects and a computational study of scraped clickbait headlines that compared four clickbait classifers using a testing sample of real-world share data. In the following section, we explain why certain characteristics of headlines might be more engaging than others and why diferences in the basic assumptions of computational models might be problematic for its classifcation."

      "text": "The headline serves an important role in a news story because it helps orient readers to the information, summarizing its key ideas, and serving as an attention grabber [2, 12]. As Dor [12] explains, a headline is “a communicative device whose function is to produce the optimal level of afnity between the content of the story and the reader’s context of interpretation, in order to render the story optimally relevant for the reader” (p. 720). Rooted in traditional print journalism as essentially a tool for improving usability of newspapers, the headline has become a critically important feature of digital media because a click on it is directly related to revenue. While news organizations acknowledge the importance of a click, they work to accomplish that goal without compromising their journalistic standards [40]. This is not the case for other types of content that circulate online. Many unreliable websites (e.g., junk science and conspiracy theories) utilize strategies such as clickbait to lure audiences into reading their content, but end up not meeting users’ expectations once they click on the headline [6]."

      "text": "But, how do clickbaits gain user attention? The way in which headlines are written or framed has powerful efects on how the story is perceived. By framing the headline in a particular manner, the author makes some aspects of the text more salient compared to others, in turn promoting a particular defnition, interpretation, or proposition [16]. Making particular pieces of information more noticeable and meaningful enhances the likelihood that the reader will perceive them, process them, store them in memory, and engage with them. For example, in Tannenbaum [41], the author presented three diferent groups of participants with the same article varying only in how the headline of a trial story was framed—guilty, innocent, or neutral. Participants who were assigned to the guilty condition were more likely to identify the person of the news article as guilty, while those in the innocent condition were more likely to think the person was innocent. Similarly, in Ecker and colleagues [15], participants exposed to misleading headlines in commentary articles were less likely to engage in inferential reasoning, compared to participants who were presented with headlines congruent with the article. The diferent efects in user perception and processing of information occurs because the headline is the frst item to be encoded into memory and it helps readers assign relevance. The headline provides signals to the reader such that “the observer allocates cognitive resources toward certain environmental features because the communicator deems that information as more relevant to the observer than other information” [27] (p. 131). As such, users will read the story with a particular schema derived from the headline [4, 11, 15]. This schema, in turn, facilitates retrieval of information related to the headline, thus biasing the manner in which the story is processed by readers."

This is because sensationalist content arouses curiosity and clicking on it enables self-experience. On the other hand, commenting behavior helps construct group identity and allows for self-expression. This example reveals that even though users might be equally interested in sensationalist and public-afairs content, they express their interest through diferent engagement actions available on social media. Similarly, Kormelink and Meijer [22] found that users will sometimes fnd an article interesting, yet will not click on it. This occurs when the headline is informationally complete (the user feels there is nothing additional to learn from reading the story) or when there is an associative gap (the headline does not tell enough for the user to want to click on it). In other words, for users to be persuaded into clicking, there should be a perfect balance between providing enough information to raise curiosity and leaving the user wanting to know more about the topic."

One of them is the number of shares an article receives. The number of shares is an important metric for content creators because it refects a mechanism to increase future readership or clicks. Simply put, sharing contributes to the virality of content, in turn increasing the number of possible clicks. But, what motivates users to share one piece of online content over another? Reasons include information utility, opinion leadership, emotional impact, relevance, entertainment, and social cohesion [3, 14, 33, 42]. Importantly, a large percentage of articles in social media are shared without being clicked upon, which means the users are persuaded to share by the headline alone. A large-scale Twitter analysis [17] revealed that nearly 60% of the shared URLs are never clicked upon. This means that the headline of the article on its own is sufcient to trigger the information utility, emotional impact, and other motivations needed for a user to share an article."

When the user is alerted about such a gap, s/he will do the needful to close that gap, which in the case of clickbait headlines means reading the article to satiate the need to know.

The author states that curiosity will be greater when information is perceived as likely to close that knowledge gap and when the piece is perceived as providing insight (or a quick solution) rather than incremental solutions. Given the several factors needed to arouse curiosity, it is not surprising that we see mixed fndings regarding the efects of clickbait headlines on actual user engagement [5, 36, 37, 44].

Seven characteristics are recurrent: questions, lists, wh words (why, where, when, what), demonstrative adjectives (e.g., here, this, these), positive superlatives, (e.g., best, bigger), negative superlatives (e.g., worst, ever), and modals (e.g., should, would) (see Table 1 for defnitions). Nonetheless, despite agreement that these stylistic features are common among clickbait headlines, studies have found conficting results. One possibility for these mixed results is that some characteristics are more successful than others. In this paper, we explore which of these seven characteristics or stylistic features of clickbait are better at generating engagement, if indeed they are more efective than non-clickbait headline, and what are the psychological mechanisms that lead to higher engagement. More formally, we propose:"

Identifying which headlines meet this criterion is challenging, especially for a computational model because the concept must be defned with sufcient level of concreteness with features that represent “clickbaitiness” for machine distinction. As such, there are important decisions and assumptions that scholars must make when building computational models for the detection of clickbait. The frst decision to make is what data to use for training the algorithm and how to label it. While some scholars opt for human labeling of data by asking annotators to identify if a headline is clickbait or not (e.g., [6]), others are based on weak supervision techniques such as assuming that certain sources are more likely to produce clickbait headlines (e.g., [13, 26]) and thereby labeling all headlines from a given source as clickbaits.

      "text": "Another important decision to make when building automated clickbait detectors is the type of machine learning model to use. For example, some detectors are based on traditional machine learning such as Naïve Bayes or Support Vector Machine (e.g. [13]), while others employ a more complex deep learning model (e.g. [36]). Each model has unique assumptions and characteristics that can afect the classifcation decision. Classical Naïve Bayes with bag-of-words features, for example, does not fully take into account the sequential dependency between words. This means that each feature or word is independent, and there is no intermediate representation between word and output. Thus, for Naïve Bayes models with bagof-words (excluding punctuation marks), the headline “Want to Hear Biden and Harris Plans for Next Year?” is the same as “Biden and Harris Want to Hear Plans for Next Year.” The model would not diferentiate between the two, and classify both in the same way (i. e., both clickbait or both non-clickbait). On the other hand, more sophisticated deep learning models learn representations or features of the input texts and use these features for prediction, and unlike in Naïve Bayes (with bag-of-words), these features can be interpreted as interactions among the words in the sentence. Additionally, deep learning models can learn shortcuts that might generalize to some unseen text but are sometimes not very meaningful [18]. Thus, for deep learning models, the aforementioned headlines might not be equivalent. In other words, the model could classify the frst as clickbait and the second as non-clickbait (or the other way around). While a Naïve Bayes classifer can learn the dependency among words located near each other by using n-gram features with n>1 or by converting the headline using word2vec instead of bag-ofwords, this still does not consider the relative position of a word or"

Then, we selected headlines classifed as clickbait by all three detectors and that possessed only one of the seven clickbait characteristics (or none). We presented these headlines to participants and asked their likelihood of sharing them with their network and/or clicking the headline to read the article further. In Study 2, we conducted a similar experiment, but to control for potential content efects, we randomly assigned participants to one of eight headlines for the same news story, varying only the clickbait (or not clickbait) characteristic utilized. Participants were then directed to read the article and asked their perceptions of both the headline and the associated article. Finally, in Study 3, we analyzed real-world sharing behavior of a series of headlines classifed as clickbait by four classifers (we used the same three classifers as Study 1 and added one more classifer, resulting in a total of two deep learning models and two traditional machine learning models) and containing one of the seven clickbait characteristics.

The 8 characteristics were a within-subject factor and the type of content was a between-subject factor. We decided on a within-subject factor for the clickbait characteristic because it automatically controls for individual diferences among participants and represents a stronger test of user preference. Furthermore, we included political and nonpolitical headlines as part of our study design because research suggests a diference in engagement between these two types of content, with non-political headlines receiving higher engagement than political headlines [22]. Including both in our manipulation allows us to account for the possibility that clickbait might be more successful for non-political content compared to political content. We gathered headlines for this study by scraping them from reliable and unreliable online sources, as defned by Rony and colleagues [36], and coded them computationally using their model to determine the clickbait characteristic they possess. Then, we passed the headlines through three diferent high-accuracy clickbait detectors that identifed whether a headline is clickbait or not. We passed the headlines through three classifers to increase the robustness of our study. Classifer 1 (93% accuracy) is a deep learning model trained on 32,000 headlines derived from news organizations and coded by three volunteer coders1 [36]. Classifer 2 (93% accuracy) is a traditional machine learning algorithm (Naïve Bayes), with headlines labeled based on source assumptions2 [13].

Users are as likely (and sometimes more likely) to engage with non-clickbait headlines. The overall preference for non-clickbait headlines can be explained by how users perceived them. For starters, headlines using demonstrative adjectives and lists aroused more curiosity than the other clickbait characteristics. However, non-clickbait was similarly arousing as these two characteristics, and was more arousing than the remining fve clickbait characteristics. This runs counter to the proposition that clickbait headlines will be more arousing than non-clickbait headlines by inducing a curiosity gap [1, 6]. Likewise, non-clickbait headlines were perceived by participants as equally entertaining as clickbait headlines. As expected, non-clickbait was also perceived as less deceitful and more credible than clickbait headlines. Interestingly, demonstrative adjectives and questions were perceived as equally credible. It is also important to note the interaction efects between clickbait characteristics and type of content suggesting that some clickbait characteristics might be perceived diferently depending on whether the content is political. Nonetheless, despite these slight variations, the interaction efects still revealed that non-clickbait induce about the same (if not more) curiosity than clickbait, are perceived as equally (if not more) credible and are perceived as equally (or less) deceitful."

      "text": "Nonetheless, the null fndings of Study 2 suggests three possibilities, 1) clickbait is not as clickbaity as we think, 2) the “clickbaitiness” of clickbait headlines is not solely determined by the characteristics suggested by industry [5] and identifed by the clickbait detector in Rony et al. [36], but by other factors that help create a psychological information gap, or 3) the higher engagement of clickbait headlines (compared to non-clickbait) found in computational analysis [36, 44] might not represent engagement with clickbait per se, but third variables (or common-cause variables) attributable to the assumptions of each clickbait detector (e.g., labeling procedure for training data, type of machine learning model). If this is the case, then each detector is operating with a unique and distinct conceptualization of clickbait, which calls into question the validity of clickbait detectors. If the same concept is being captured by the different models, then they should have high agreement in classifying the same set of clickbait headlines. If they do not have high agreement, it would represent a validity issue of content classifcation systems for clickbait detection, with results being confounded with other variables such as topic distinction and system assumptions. We explore these issues in Study 3 through computational analysis of real-world number of shares of headlines scraped from reliable and unreliable sources (political and non-political). This time, we passed the headlines through four diferent clickbait classifers (the same three as in Study 1 plus a new traditional machine-learning classifer) varying in their basic assumptions of clickbait and in the type of machine-learning utilized. We added a fourth classifer in Study 3 in order to have a fully crossed factorial design that can assess diferences in engagement based on the characteristics of the classifers: 2 (Type of Model: Conventional Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning) x 2 (Data: Annotated Data vs. Source Assumptions)."

For instance, while the four classifers agreed on the clickbait classifcation more times for the negative superlative characteristic (compared to the other six characteristics), the four classifers never agreed on a non-clickbait classifcation for the negative superlative or question characteristics, as illustrated by the absence of the “non-clickbait agreement” bar."

For instance, two of the models were trained using annotated data while the other two used source assumptions as ground truth. This means that in the former, clickbait is defned in terms of the perceptions of the volunteers who classifed those headlines and their understanding of what is and what is not clickbait. On the other hand, the other two models relied on source credibility to train the model, such that headlines from sources like the Wall Street Journal are understood as being non-clickbait, while those from outlets like Buzzfeed are assumed to be clickbait. Two of the models utilized a deep learning model, while the other two utilized more classical machine-learning models (Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine). Results of Study 3 reveal that the diferences in assumptions made by each model results in a low agreement when comparing the four detectors together and generate diferent results in terms of user engagement. It is worth noting, however, that when examining the pairwise comparison among classifers, the highest total agreement was between the two human-labeled classifers—classifers 1 and 4 (see Table 6)."

      "text": "Regardless of the low agreement between the clickbait detectors, three out of the four models consistently revealed that clickbait headlines using demonstrative adjectives, lists and “wh” words resulted in higher engagement compared to non-clickbait headlines. This means that at least in an uncontrolled environment, these characteristics are more successful in luring users into clicking. Similarly, two of the four models reveal that positive superlatives are not as good as other clickbait characteristics (e.g., demonstrative adjectives) at engaging users. These diferences notwithstanding, it is important to note that some of the headlines classifed as nonclickbait by classifers still contained one of the seven characteristics of clickbait analyzed in this paper (see supplemental material for a list of headlines). This means that it is not the characteristics alone that distinguish a headline as clickbait or not clickbait. It is likely that there are other underlying linguistic properties that may elicit information gap more efectively when read in tandem with a particular characteristic."

In Study 1, we found that among the seven clickbait characteristics, users were more likely to click on “read more” for “wh” words and lists compared to modals. They were more likely to click on “read more” for lists compared to questions. However, results revealed an overall preference for non-clickbait. In fact, non-clickbait received signifcantly more clicks than modals, negative superlatives, positive superlatives, and questions, and the same as demonstrative adjectives, lists, and “wh” words. Moreover, when assessing user perception of the headlines, non-clickbait headlines elicited more curiosity than all 7 types of clickbait headlines, were perceived as less deceitful and considered more credible. The interaction effects between clickbait characteristic and type of content on user perceptions suggest that the success of clickbait is also contingent"

First, that in these studies clickbait headlines are not “clickbaity” because of the characteristics suggested by industry [5] and identifed by the clickbait detector in [36] alone, but by other factors that help create a psychological knowledge gap. Or, that the preference for clickbait is a function of third variables derived from the assumptions of the clickbait detectors. We explored these possibilities in Study 3 by comparing the classifcation of 4 diferent clickbait detectors varying in the nature of training data and the type of machine learning employed. While three of the four classifers suggest that users engage more with headlines using demonstrative adjectives, “wh” words, and lists, we found low overall agreement among the 4 classifers, such that the four of them agreed on a clickbait vs. non-clickbait classifcation only 47% of the time.

      "text": "Overall, our fndings suggest that determining whether a headline is clickbait or not is quite complex. It does not simply depend on a few key linguistic characteristics like using a listicle or framing it as a question. It also depends on the nature of the automated classifer used to distinguish clickbaits from non-clickbaits. In fact, results of our study expose the unreliability of clickbait classifers by showing low agreement between them. Like our Study 1 and 2, past studies [29, 37] conducted using experimental designs and content analysis fnd that non-clickbait is more engaging than clickbait. Studies using automatic detection [36] reveal the opposite pattern, as did our Study 3. But, in analyzing each detector in isolation, we fnd that the four models only agreed 47% of the time, which indicates the complexity of defning and classifying clickbait computationally. The noise associated with this low level of agreement raises fundamental questions about the validity of clickbait detectors and taxonomies touting objective characteristics that result from clickbait analysis. In reality, clickbait determination could be highly subjective. As the author of one of the clickbait detectors used in this study [13] states “I know it when I see it.”"

      "text": "That said, three classifers agreed that demonstrative adjectives, “wh” words and listicles performed better than non-clickbait when using real-world engagement data. These stylistic markers might be essential for clickbait headlines to be “clickbaity,” and are worthy of further testing. However, it is worth noting that we did not fnd the same efects in Study 1 and 2. This is important because, in Study 1, we selected 1) clickbait headlines that possessed only one of the seven characteristics, and 2) non-clickbait headlines that did not contain any of the characteristics (or manually adjusted to ensure that this was the case), whereas in Study 2, we further controlled for any possible content diferences by manipulating the same headline to possess one and only one or none of the characteristics. This was not the case for Study 3, where even headlines considered as non-clickbait by the four classifers appeared to have at least traces of some of the linguistic characteristics associated with clickbait headlines. For example, the headlines, “Greatest Military Coup Ever Could Now Be Underway on U.S. Soil,” and “Media Silent as Biggest Protests Since French Revolution Sweep France,” both use positive superlative words, yet were classifed as non-clickbait by the four classifers. This raises the question whether the characteristics themselves determine the ‘clickbaitiness’ of a headline or are there other linguistic mechanisms that promote user engagement? Furthermore, in Study 1 and 2, we assessed users’ perception of the headline and found a null efect (Study 2) and a slight superiority of non-clickbait headlines (Study 1). As data scientists are well aware [5], analysis of real-world engagement can be rife with confounding variables. For example, it is possible that one type of clickbait headline, more than other types, tends to be placed on the upper part of the news site, generating more clicks partly because of its placement rather than the headline alone. This type of confound could lead to a form of Simpson’s Paradox [5], where the direction of an association may be reversed when analyzing the subgroups of that population [21]. This is what we may be witnessing in Study 3. The many third variables associated with real-world engagement data coupled with the low reliability of the detectors found in our study sheds light on the possibility that the greater engagement of clickbait reported in computational studies should be interpreted with caution because the engagement might not be due to actual “clickbaitiness” or the knowledge gap hypothesis, but rather due to contextual factors and interface elements unrelated to clickbait."

For starters, headlines written as non-clickbait receive the same or equal engagement compared to clickbait headlines. Moreover, users perceive non-clickbait as more credible and less deceptive. They are also able to induce user curiosity to a higher extent than clickbait, probably because they are processed more deeply by users.

Our results suggest that the success of future detectors should be analyzed beyond their individual performance (the four classifers in this study had high accuracy scores), but also based on their concurrent validity. In other words, detectors should be assessed by comparing them to other clickbait measures to assess their ability to accurately and consistently detect clickbait. One idea can be to test how the detector performs in comparison to human classifers. Insights into those results can provide ideas to improve detection accuracy by assessing potential areas of disagreement. Another approach proposed by scholars studying fake news [28] is for the computational sciences to collaborate with the social sciences when building machine learning models for the detection of abstract concepts such as clickbait. For example, the social sciences can help identify features essential for clickbait detection or other abstract concepts, which can then be used to build algorithms for the detection of such content."

It is possible that other characteristics of clickbait not represented in our research are more successful than the ones we selected. Similarly, we utilized headlines that only possessed one of the seven characteristics. The goal of our research was to identify which of those characteristics is more engaging. However, there could be a potential additive efect that we did not account for. Secondly, in our user studies (Study 1 and 2), we used a sample of M-Turkers and students; though no diference was found across populations, it is not a representative sample of the U.S. population which might be less technologically savvy compared to Turkers and college students. However, while our sample is not representative, college students are as likely to fall for persuasive linguistic strategies such as clickbait, as the normal population. In fact, a study [46] found that college students performed worse than high school students in a reasoning task to evaluate online information. It is also worth noting that the scraped headlines utilized for Study 3 is considerably small, compared to other feld studies conducted to analyze headline engagement. Nonetheless, our fndings align with Scacco and Muddiman [37], whose feld analysis of 5288 headlines revealed higher engagement of non-clickbait headline. Though our Study 3 does reveal a slight preference for a few clickbait characteristics (demonstrative adjectives, “wh” words, and listicles), these fndings should also be analyzed with caution given potential confounds of real-world engagement analysis discussed earlier, and the rather low agreement rate among the detectors.
