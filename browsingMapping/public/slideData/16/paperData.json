    "text": "ABSTRACT As smartphone use increases dramatically, so do studies about technology overuse. Many diferent mobile apps for breaking “smartphone addiction” and achieving “digital wellbeing” are available. However, it is still not clear whether and how such solutions work. Which functionality do they have? Are they efective and appreciated? Do they have a relevant impact on users’ behavior? To answer these questions, (i) we reviewed the features of 42 digital wellbeing apps, (ii) we performed a thematic analysis on 1,128 user reviews of such apps, and (iii) we conducted a 3-week-long in-the-wild study of Socialize, an app that includes the most common digital wellbeing features, with 38 participants. We discovered that digital wellbeing apps are appreciated and useful for some specifc situations. However, they do not promote the formation of new habits and they are perceived as not restrictive enough, thus not efectively helping users to change their behavior with smartphones."

Through smartphones, users can nowadays perform many diferent tasks such as browsing the web, reading emails, and using social networks. As smartphone use increases dramatically [39], however, so do studies about the negative impact of overusing technology. Smartphones, in particular, have been found to be a source of distraction [3], and their excessive use can be a problem for mental health [27] and social interaction [31]. Furthermore, smartphones serve as a gateway for a variety of mobile applications that can result in addictive behaviors [11], e.g., constantly checking social networks. As a consequence, HCI researchers started to pay more attention to the feld of intentional “non-use” of technology [5, 40, 48], and the term “smartphone addiction” has gained interest both in the literature and in mainstream media [29]. Many diferent mobile apps can currently be used as tools for changing users’ behavior with smartphones, and even Google and Apple recently announced new tools for monitoring, understanding, and limiting technology use in their operating systems, with the aim of promoting a more conscious use of the smartphone. Google, in particular, summarized its commitment with the term “digital wellbeing”:"

Second, we extracted 1,128 reviews left by users for these 42 apps, and we conducted a thematic analysis to gain insight about the users’ experience with digital wellbeing apps and their features. Third, we designed and implemented Socialize, our own digital wellbeing app, by integrating the most common digital wellbeing features extracted during our functionality review. We conducted a three-week in-thewild study of Socialize with 38 participants. Our aim was to gain a quantitative insight into the fndings stemming from the frst 2 qualitative studies, thus assessing whether the features that contemporary digital wellbeing solutions share are efective for changing behavior and promoting a more conscious use of the smartphone.

By using self-monitoring functionality, in particular, such apps are efective for temporary breaking some unhealthy behaviors, e.g., the excessive use of social networks, but they fail in other circumstances. For example, by ofering functionality that can be easily bypassed, they do not prevent users from constantly checking their devices. • We discuss the results and we propose a series of insights to inform future works and go beyond selfmonitoring techniques. Promising areas to be explored include the design of digital wellbeing apps that support the formation of new habits and promote selfregulation through social support."

      "text": "Due to their accessibility and functionality, smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives and their use increased dramatically in the last few years [39]. Smartphones, in particular, serve as a gateway to many diferent mobile apps and online services, giving the users a world of possibility, such as browsing the web, messaging, and checking social networks. Unfortunately, despite many advantages and increasing opportunities for social support [44], the excessive usage of smartphones and online services often exhibits negative efects on mental health [27] and social interaction [31]. Mobile device use can sometimes disrupt the introspective processes that accompany in-person social interaction [22], preventing one from understanding the psychological states of others and thereby empathizing with them [20]. This can afect the quality of face-to-face conversations [45], resulting in a shift from vertical relationships that require long-term efort and commitment, to horizontal relationships that indicate an expanded network of shallow relationships [14]. Furthermore, several studies demonstrate that smartphones are a source of distractions that interferes with daily activities and ongoing tasks such as studying, working, and driving [3, 16]. Distractions can be caused by external stimuli, e.g., notifcations, but also by internal stimuli [10], e.g., users that interrupt themselves by frequently checking emails [39]. Users that experience frequent and unpredictable external or internal interruptions, in particular, tend to feel less productive [35] and more stressed [36]. As a result, the term “smartphone addiction” has become popular in research studies [7, 11, 29]. Technology-related addictions can be classifed as behavioral addictions [8]: interactive devices induce and reinforce features that may promote addictive tendencies [33]. Even if the addiction framing may not be appropriate for widespread and everyday behaviors like mobile devices use [28], people often perceive their excessive smartphone use as problematic [23, 42], and they are willing to adopt diferent strategies to mitigate such a behavior [23]. Problematic smartphone use, in particular, can be identifed through self-reported questionnaires [6, 37] or through computational methods [30, 42]. Our work stems from the technology overuse research with the aim of exploring and understanding how contemporary solutions for changing users’ behavior with smartphones work, whether they are sufcient, and how we could improve them."

      "text": "Our understanding of how to design for self-regulation of technology use, however, is still in its early days [47]. Apps for digital wellbeing have not been extensively evaluated by researchers and it is yet not clear how efective they are. Only a limited number of previous works [9, 34] analyze commercially available tools, by focusing on productivity, mainly. Furthermore, the tools proposed in the literature against smartphone addiction are designed for evaluating specifc use cases [17, 22, 23, 32]. Hiniker et al. [17], for example, propose MyTime, an intervention app to support people in achieving goals related to smartphone non-use. With AppDetox [32], instead, users can defne simple rules to block the usage of certain apps. Ko et al. [22] developed Lock n’ LoL, a mobile app that helps students focus on their group activities by allowing group members to limit their smartphone usage together. In another mobile app, called NUGU, Ko et al. [23] demonstrate that self-regulation can be improved by leveraging social support, i.e., groups of people that limit their use together by sharing their limiting information. Despite a growing interest on the topic, previous work fails in providing a comprehensive view of existing digital wellbeing apps and their features, and open questions still remain. Little is known, for example, about whether contemporary digital wellbeing apps are capable of supporting the formation of new habits. A habit is defned as a consistent repetition of a behavior in the presence of stable contextual cues that increases the automaticity of that behavior [26]. With smartphones, habits can be defned as automated smartphone usage sessions associated with explicit contexts such as location, performed activity, and emotional state [39]. Habit formation techniques could play an important role in digital wellbeing apps, supporting behavior change and ensuring its long-term efects [26]. Such techniques, in particular, could help users in forming new habits a) that promote a meaningful smartphone use, e.g, using an educational app to learn something new in the evening, or b) that discourage smartphone use in a given situation, e.g, going for a walk in the leisure time instead of playing Candy Crush. In our work we would like to close this gap, by trying to understand issues and opportunities for this “race” towards digital wellbeing. To reach our goal, we review the most common features ofered by contemporary commercial digital"

At the same time, we we did not fnd a signifcant diference in the self-reported questionnaires about problematic use (SAS-SV scale) and self-regulation (GSE scale) before and after the study. To further analyze whether and how Socialize impacted the smartphone use, we extracted other information from the large amount of collected data. We frst tried to understand whether there were diferences in how participants used their smartphones during the study. In particular, we analyzed the daily average number of times participants used their smartphones very frequently, i.e., with phone sessions at a distance of less than a minute, thus demonstrating a compulsive phone checking behavior. Also in this case, we did not fnd signifcant diferences: participants behaved similarly in the collection phase (M = 49.70, SD = 36.91) and in the intervention phase (M = 52.45, SD = 42.91, p > 0.05).

During the intervention phase, participants set up 41 interventions in total: 6 phone timers, 11 app timers, 7 phone blockers, 16 app blockers, and 1 phone break. Users demonstrated to prefer blockers (23) with respect to timers (17). Furthermore, intervention data suggest that participants were more interested in acting at the applevel, rather than setting interventions at the phone-level: by considering the interventions available for both levels, i.e., timers and blockers, participants set up 27 app-level interventions (67.50%), while only 13 (32.50%) were set up at the phone level. Participants, in particular, defned the majority of app-level interventions for limiting the usage of social networks: 10 of them were defned for Faceboook, 14 for Instagram. Since we found that participants signifcantly reduced the time spent on social networks during the intervention phase, we may conclude that app-level interventions are efective in limiting the usage of this type of apps. Diferences also emerged when analyzing whether interventions were respected, snoozed, or deleted. Participants deleted 3 of the 6 defned timers (50.00%) before the end of the intervention phase.

Through such techniques, users experience the feeling of success, a fundamental aspect to strengthen new habits [2]. Satisfaction can trigger the feeling of being in control, thus motivating the users and reinforcing the need to repeat the action in the future [2]. Unfortunately, this cannot work in the long term, since the role of motivation decreases as the behavior becomes automatic [38]. Our second study confrms this fnding, showing that contemporary digital wellbeing apps are mainly designed to break existing habits, instead of developing new habits. Breaking habits, however, is frustrating, and users need to be continuously motivated in continuing the monitoring behavior to efectively use such apps. Contemporary digital wellbeing apps totally lack other fundamental aspects of the habit formation process, such as providing cues and trigger events [43]: new habits linked with some routines, e.g., turn of the phone when I am having lunch, are generally easier to remember, and each repetition reinforces that association, which increases the automaticity of the behavior [15]. In addition, despite previous studies demonstrated that social support can increase self-regulation of smartphone usage [23], existing digital wellbeing apps do not seem to be designed with a focus on promoting self-regulation through social support. The possibility of comparing statistics with other users, for example, is rarely introduced. According to the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [4], however, learning occurs in a social context and much of what is learned is gained through observation: through social learning, people can have better awareness of normative behaviors and can also be motivated to self-regulate."

For example, only a limited number of apps allow users to compare their own statistics with the statistics of other users. This limitation is also highlighted by the same users, that frequently ask for introducing the possibility to interact with other users in their reviews. As in previous studies, e.g., [23], we claim that digital wellbeing apps should promote self-regulation through social support, and should be more grounded in the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [4]. Beside comparing statistics, many diferent solutions could be adopted. As requested by some users in our studies, users could interact through “social games”, with the possibility of setting goals, rewarding mechanism in case of success, and penalties in case of failures. Perhaps the most interesting result of our work is that users want restrictive solutions to limit their excessive smartphone use. Users feel that unrestrictive and bypassable solutions are not enough for changing their behaviors with the smartphone, and this is especially confrmed by the results of our in-the-wild study: interventions are often snoozed or deleted, and digital wellbeing apps fail in preventing addictive behaviors, e.g., the compulsive checking of the smartphone. As a result, future work in this feld should explore the adoption of restrictive interventions, difcult to be bypassed, that penalize users when they do not respect an intervention. Finally, results of our studies suggest that digital wellbeing apps should be focused at the app-level rather than phone-level, and they should provide users with accurate and explainable statistics. In line with previous work [11], indeed, participants of our in-the-wild study signifcantly set up and respected more interventions for limiting the usage of specifc apps, while users’ reviews often point out that focusing on the phone-level is not enough. Furthermore, reviews suggest that bugs, especially those related to the accuracy of the visualized statistics, highly afect the usefulness and the usability of digital wellbeing apps. Indeed, such bugs are difcult to detect, and users are often not able to distinguish if high usage data are due to an addictive behavior or an application bug."

In this paper, we have presented the results of 3 diferent studies with the aim of providing the frst overall perspective of existing mobile apps for changing users’ behavior with smartphone. Results show that despite contemporary digital wellbeing apps can be used to reduce some addictive behaviors, e.g., using social networks, the road for efectively helping users in changing their behaviors with smartphones and promoting a more conscious technology use is still long. For closing this gap, we have proposed suggestions to be explored in future work: we are currently exploring digital wellbeing solutions that are more grounded in habit formation and social support theories, with the aim of overcoming the drawbacks of pure self-monitoring techniques."
