    "text": "ABSTRACT Worlds-in-Miniature (WiMs) are interactive worlds within a world and combine the advantages of an input space, a cartographic map, and an overview+detail interface. They have been used across the extended virtuality spectrum for a variety of applications. Building on an analysis of examples of WiMs from the research literature we contribute a design space for WiMs based on seven design dimensions. Further, we expand upon existing defnitions of WiMs to provide a defnition that applies across the extended reality spectrum. We identify the design dimensions of size-scope-scale, abstraction, geometry, reference frame, links, multiples, and virtuality. Using our framework we describe existing Worlds-in-Miniature from the"

For example, a replica that can be held in a viewer’s hands may be 30 cm in diameter (Figure 3). Scope describes how much of the world is represented by the replica. For example, the replica could show just a single object, or it could show an entire city (Figure 4). Scale describes the relationship between the size of the model and the space it represents. These relationships are connected — if one is changed, at least one other must also change. For example, if the size of the replica increases from 1 × 1 m to 3 × 3 m the scale would either need to be 3 times larger, the scope would need to encompass more objects, or some combination of the two."

While we have identifed size, scale, and scope as a set of interdependent dimensions, there is a strong positive correlation between the size of a WiM, and its scope — with developers typically using larger WiMs to represent larger and more complex regions (Figure 11). By contrast, the set of systems we examined contain no examples of small or very small WiMs whose scope showed anything larger than a single building. Surprisingly we also saw no examples of large WiMs whose scope was smaller than the foor of a building, although the interactive virtual globes in tools like Google Earth VR [23] clearly demonstrate the value of this combination. While in most cases it is practical to pair large sizes with broad scopes there may be opportunities where straying from these pattern can be benefcial. As a temporary, or transitional state, having a large WiM with a small scope could be used to highlight an object of interest, such as greatly expanding the sign for a bus stop in the replica as the viewer gets within viewing distance of the actual sign. As another example, if many small multiples of individual small WiMs with broad scopes are used together, the size of each can be controlled with a focus + context operation like"

A WiM with a reference frame that is close to, or a part of the body (pericutaneous, peripersonal) is more likely to also be small. While a WiM with a reference frame that is a part of the environment, or the environment itself (extrapersonal), is more likely to be large. Both of these can be explained from a practical standpoint, a WiM that is several meters in diameter would be unwieldy when placed on a viewers wrist. Further, if a WiM that was only a few centimetres in diameter was placed on a boardroom table many meters wide there would be a large amount of wasted space. However, these impracticalities can be overcome. For example, Tatzgern et al. [45] explore a small WiM that has an extrapersonal reference frame by physically distancing the replica from the reference frame — while the referent is large, its apparent size is comparable to the WiM. At the other end of the spectrum, a large WiM can be placed within a viewer’s personal space by distributing it around their body — for instance, by projecting it in a torus around their torso, or distributing it across their limbs (which we explore in subsection 6.2)."

In contrast, larger WiMs are often bounded by a feature of the environment (such as a work table). Although WiMs at all sizes are bounded by simple shapes. At the extreme end, any unbounded WiM showing a large area or object will consume considerable space — as it has no solid boundary to constrain it. However, even when considering a large WiM it can be benefcial to restrict the geometry to just the object of interest. For example, for a team collaborating around a WiM of a to-be-built building, reducing the WiM to just the building of interest could help manage occlusion from multiple vantage points."

We suspect that this has more to do with the current capabilities of the respective technologies than a practical relationship between the dimensions. It is currently much easier to create a replica that is a perfect or near perfect copy of the environment in VR than it is in AR. However, as technologies like photogrammetry improve, and as AR headset technology matures and becomes more powerful this gap is likely to close. With the ability to easily create realistic views of real places, applications like third person bird’s eye views [17] will likely become more realistic outside of VR. On the fip side, while VR instances of WiMs are currently able to feature replicas that are perfect recreations of the VR environment, simplifed or generalised replicas can still help viewers focus on the most important features of the replica [41]."

In circumstances where a component is not shared between the two (such as a part of the building that is not built yet, or a detail of the building too small to be added to the model) the area where that component would be is instead highlighted. In Figure 18 a viewer is selecting the roof at the top of the replica, in the background they can see the roof being highlighted on a AR overlay of the building.

To examine this unique combination, we propose a system that takes advantage of the viewer’s entire body to host a large WiM (Figure 19). In this example the buildings of a college campus are spread across the viewer’s body. Buildings that are close to the viewer are placed on parts of their body that are easy to reference (like their forearms) whereas buildings that are far away are placed on less reachable, but still visible parts of their body (like their shins). Buildings behind or otherwise outside the viewer’s feld of vision are likewise shifted to less-visible locations on the body (such as their calves) where they can be seen peripherally. This approach cartographically generalises important landmarks including prominent buildings using an approach similar to the automatic tourist maps proposed by Grabler et al. [19], highlighting the most important features of the campus and de-emphasising the spaces in between them. By viewing the WiM with a headset AR device the viewer could easily reference buildings in their immediate vicinity, while maintaining a peripheral knowledge of the entire campus. This could be particularly useful while the viewer is walking, allowing them to use their body’s sense of proprioception [8] to reference the replica. Such an approach could also be useful in crowded spaces, ftting tightly to the viewer’s body when most large AR objects would be occluded or intersected by the surrounding environment."

In this example, the system includes two multiples, each showing the same hiking route. The large multiple on the left side of the screen (Figure 20) shows the entire mountain that is being hiked, while the smaller multiple on the right side of the screen (Figure 20) is clipped to focus on just the current trail segment.

Many of these unexplored points, including the examples in section 6 refect promising opportunities for near-term research and design. Others highlight challenges both in our current tools and technology. For example, varying the level of abstraction in WiMs still represents a challenge in both VR and AR, and most conceptual abstraction (and even much of the visual abstraction) used in current systems is still handled manually by designers. Meanwhile, creating truly realistic WiMs remains challenging because current platforms lack both the data and processing power necessary to create high-fdelity representations of most scenes. This is especially challenging for augmented- and mixed-reality applications, given the host of challenges associated with capturing, rendering, and updating visually accurate and up-to-date representations of physical environments. However, rapidly maturing photogrammetry and real-time scene reconstruction approaches mean that realistic live WiMs of real-world spaces will likely be possible in the near future. Parallel advances in XR headsets and related display technologies will also make using these WiMs in real-world environments increasingly practical. With that in mind, exploring new WiM designs, interactions, and application areas represents a rich area for research both now and for the foreseeable future."
