Advances in graphical processing, displays, IMU integration, and other technologies have enabled highly compelling visual and audio experiences in commodity hardware, even on mobile devices. Despite these recent improvements in visual and auditory output, haptic feedback has yet to see the same degree of adoption. While some VR technologies use vibrotactile actuators to induce tactile haptic feedback, these technologies fail to elicit the experience of continuous force, such as feeling an object's weight or an otherwise tugging of the hand. This feeling of the continuous force is sensed through a kinesthetic sensation, and the classes of haptic devices that can simulate continuous forces are generally referred to as force feedback or kinesthetic haptic devices.\nWhile there has been extensive research on developing force feedback devices, enabling force feedback in immersive VR environments is still challenging. This is because most force feedback devices require grounding, i.e., they need to be attached to a heavy object or otherwise fixed in place in order to be able to produce the forces needed and withstand reciprocal kickback [18,37,42,43]. Approaches to grounded force feedback include the use of mechanical joints [5,9,12,42,43], wires that are pulled [3,18], air jet actuators [30,31,34] or electromagnets [35,37]. While such methods can provide realistic and compelling force feedback in place, we are interested in exploring ungrounded force feedback to enable more mobile use cases. Grounded devices enable the administering of strong and accurate forces, but come with the caveat that they have to be located in the vicinity of the grounded structure.\nResearchers have previously developed several ways to create ungrounded force feedback by, for example, making the grounding structure worn on the back [19,27], producing haptic illusions via asynchronous oscillations [4,28], or using electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) [14,[23][24][25]. These methods, however, have several limitations. Creating force feedback by pushing against a frame worn on the body requires users to wear a large and heavy device [19,27] and creates an unintended kickback in reaction to the intended feedback force. Simulating force feedback via haptic illusions [4,28] severely limits the strength of the perceived forces (< 0.3 N), which may further diminish when such methods are used for multidimensional forces [28]. As EMS methods [14,23,25] require users to attach electrodes to their body, they require a calibration procedure prior to use, and their output is limited to forces in the direction of one's muscular alignment. This paper presents Thor's Hammer, an ungrounded 3-DOF force feedback device that can create large and continuous forces using propeller propulsion (Figure 1a). Propeller propulsion is a method of creating thrust by pushing air using a rotating propeller. Thor's Hammer orients its propulsion force with three degrees of freedom, by using three pairs of opposing propellers that have been mounted onto the device and oriented orthogonally to one another (Figure 1b). Each propeller may be rotated to provide force in one of the cardinal directions, or in arbitrary force vectors by coordinating their propulsion.\nA technical evaluation of Thor's Hammer demonstrated that it can create 4 N of force in three dimensions with an RMSE of less than 0.11 N. Force vectors may be oriented arbitrarily, with an RMSE of less than 3.9\u00b0. Despite these advantages, there are disadvantages to the approach: the reliance on propellers for generating force provides latency (309.4 ms on average), and the arrangement requires an apparatus that is physically larger than typical VR controllers.\nWe developed VR scenarios where a user experiences the buoyancy and drag of the water flow, the tugging of a leashed animal, the resistance of a button that has been pressed, and the weight of an object. We also conducted a user study to examine users' impressions of the force feedback provided by Thor's Hammer in enhancing these experiences. Participants found the device's force feedback to be realistic and improved the immersive experience of the VR.\nIn this paper, we thus make the following contributions:", "n_publication_ref": 32, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "A demonstration of a propeller-based 3-DOF ungrounded force-feedback device. 2.

Torso-grounded devices [19,27] are worn on a user's back and use motors to pull tension wires attached to a haptic handle through a rigid frame that extends around the workspace in front of the wearer's body. The use of wires makes the device lighter than using a robotic linkage, however, it requires a frame larger than the required workspace, making it cumbersome to wear because the wires can only pull the haptic feedback handle.\nHand-grounded force feedback devices [8,10,13,20,44,45] allow users to experience the sensation of grasping. Some haptic gloves [8,13] provide passive force feedback by using a brake instead of a motor to stop movement of the fingers, thus making the device lighter and more robust to strong grasping.

Winfree et al. [38] implemented a handheld device with motors controlling two gimbals and showed that it could create torque in arbitrary directions on two axes with a maximum torque of 1.2 Nm.\nUsing gyroscope-based force feedback techniques, however, can only create torque in up to two axes, as the flywheel rotation cannot be used to create torque.

Furthermore, AirGlove [17] is a hand-worn device that has six air nozzles that can exert up to 7.3 N of force in three dimensions.

While drones could provide passive haptic feedback when being touched or moved by the user's hand [15], researchers demonstrated that drones could provide active haptic feedback by flying towards the user's hand [21,39], although the feedback can only create up to 0.118 N of force [39].

Thor's Hammer has six 2600KV T-Motor F40 III brushless motors (and accompanying tri-blade propellers) to generate bidirectional thrust in three axes. Each tri-blade propeller has a length of 127 mm, a pitch of 114.3 mm, and creates an outward airflow, away from the carbon fiber frame. Instead of rotating one propeller in two directions to create pushing and pulling forces, the device uses two propellers, which push the air to change the direction of the force by controlling the throttle to minimize latency when inverting the rotating direction of each motor.\nSurrounding the motors and propellers is a motor frame that was built using 10 mm-diameter carbon fiber pipes. This frame allows each motor to be mounted in its necessary location. External to this frame was a cage frame that was assembled with 8 mm-diameter carbon fiber pipes and have a badminton string weaved mesh with 10 mm spacing surrounding it. This frame and mesh provides structural support for the device and acts as a safety mechanism, while still maximizing the airflow from the device and also minimizing device weight. A handle is wrapped with a hightraction racket grip and affixed to the outside of the frame and mesh to enable a user to hold the device. All joints, motor mounts, and the handle were 3D printed. The resulting dimensions of the device are 208 mm \u00d7 208 mm \u00d7 208 mm (without a handle, whose length is 120 mm and diameter 34 mm). The total weight of the device is 692 g, excluding the wires necessary to connect the motors to the drive board.\nSix ES30 HV electronic speed controllers (ESC) are used to power the motors and are placed on a drive board to reduce the weight of the device. Due to the electrical requirements, two 14V 350W power supplies are used to run the prototype device. Because stopping the brushless motors can result in a high-voltage current back flow, SR1050 Schottky diodes have been added between the ESCs and power supplies. An Arduino Leonardo installed on the drive board controls the ESCs using PWM signals and communicates with a PC through a USB connection.\nWe used a VICON optical tracking system to track the device's position and orientation in a virtual environment.\nPosition and orientation of the device are essential to locate it in the virtual environment and to enable force vectors in environment space rather than relative to the orientation of the device. For example, if a user puts a virtual wooden stick into the water, the buoyancy force should change by the stick location and should remain 'upward' relative to the real world regardless of the device orientation.

The device control software calculates the throttle for each motor and sends motor control messages to the Arduino.\nWhen the device starts, all motors begin rotating at a minimum speed of 1200 rpm, to minimize the latency of subsequently applying a propeller force. As single axis force is created by combining the throttles of two motors, the device produces a 3-DOF force by combining the three force vectors created by the three pairs of motors.

Attached to each center of the frame, were six calibrated load cells that could measure up to 5 kg of force (CZL635). The frame was raised 300 mm above the ground.\nThe prototype was suspended within the aluminum frame using six steel wires to minimize the probable effect of the aluminum frame magnifying the force magnitude. Each wire connected a motor mount to a load cell and had a plastic tensioner to tighten the wire. The handle and weaved mesh were removed during the entire measurement process.\nThe load cells were connected to HX711 load cell amplifiers that amplify and digitize the sensor values with 24-bit Analog-Digital converters.

Each force feedback pattern was activated for 3 seconds and tested in both directions on all three axes. There were second breaks between each direction and axis change.\nThe average output force as a relation of the input force was calculated from the measurements, for all three axes (Figure 4b). The device was able to exert force at 4 N in each of the six directions on three axes, which is comparable to a commercial grounded 3-DOF force feedback device, Geomagic Touch [42], which can exert force up to 3.3 N. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of the output force against the input force for X, Y, and Z-axes were 0.077 N, 0.084 N, and 0.148 N, respectively.\nTo investigate the stability of the force during a constant force exertion, the standard deviation of the force magnitudes were calculated using the axes and force levels.\nAs our focus was to measure the fluctuations while exerting a constant force, we excluded force measurements for the first 500 ms, which may have included measurements before the force reached its target level. Thus, only the measurements during the latter 2500 ms were used to compute the standard deviations (Figure 4c). Based on the measurements, there appears to be a tendency for the force fluctuations to increase as the exertion force increases. The standard deviation was lower than 0.05 N, except for a positive z-axis force, which was measured to be 0.08 N. This trend can also be observed in the raw measurement graph (Figure 4a).\nTo measure the latency of increasing and decreasing the force, we wrote a program that would exert forces with different magnitudes along the three axes for 2 seconds, then immediately reducing the force magnitude to 0 N. Acceleration and deceleration time were obtained by measuring the time between the signal trigger moment and the moment when the force reached within \u00b1 0.15 N of the target force (Figure 5a). The results demonstrated that the acceleration time remained similar regardless of the force change, and the deceleration time was shorter when a smaller amount of force was reduced (Figure 5bc).

The noise levels for 2 N of force were approximately 70 dB, which is similar to the noise heard when taking a shower, and for 4N was approximately 80.7 dB, which is similar to the noise of garbage disposal. Although users may wear headphones when using VR, the noise created by Thor's Hammer is a limitation of the device. While eliminating all noise would be impossible, future work could consider using methods developed for noise reduction in other devices, such as drones. This includes active noise cancellation [36] or using sound damping material.\nAnother important issue is safety. We used a weaved mesh to prevent hand and finger injury due to contact with the spinning propeller blades. However, there is still a possibility that some small objects may pass through the mesh, hit a propeller blade, and fly back through the mesh. To avoid this, we ensured that the workplace was free of debris.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Feedback Responsiveness", "text": "Another concern is the latency of the haptic feedback. While our device can create continuous and strong force feedback, the device's 300 milliseconds latency may not be appropriate for haptic scenarios that require instantaneous or highly responsive feedback, such as hitting a rigid surface. This concern was brought up by one participant in the user study, who noted that the feedback was not responsive enough to follow his movements for the sheep-herding scenario. The latency can also make a disparity between the intended and actual force orientation, e.g., if a user rotates the device at a rotational speed of 90\u00b0/sec, a user may experience approx. 27\u00b0 of orientation disparity between what they expect and feel. In prior work, Lopes, Ion, and Baudisch found that using a blend of haptic feedback techniques with different characteristics can complement the limitations of each technique [24]. Future iterations of Thor's Hammer could also utilize a blend of different haptic feedback techniques and motion prediction to reduce latency. We also believe that building a closed control loop by adding force sensors under each motor could enable PID control of the force feedback for a more precise and responsive force feedback.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Ease of Replication", "text": "The off-the-shelf and 3D-printed nature of Thor's Hammer enables it to be easily replicated. Since the force created along each axis is independent from the other axes, calibration can be performed on a per-axis basis. We expect this to be easily replicated by researchers and designers. We will make the drawings, CAD files, firmware source code, force control software, and force control Unity API available online 1 , so that those who want to use the force feedback can build and use this device.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Extensibility to Other Shapes", "text": "While the present implementation uses a cubic frame that is 208 mm in each dimension, the frame can be built in a number of different shapes and sizes by changing the size of motors and propellers, and by reducing the number of propellers based on the desired types of forces. The present implementation is handheld, but if smaller propellers and motors were used, it could be miniaturized such that it could be attached on a bracelet or armband. It could also be attached to another physical prop such as a gun game controller to augment it with a force feedback.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Untethered and Mobile", "text": "Making Thor's Hammer truly mobile requires many considerations, with power consumption being of utmost concern. Our estimation showed that it could exert 2 N of continuous force for 19 minutes on a 4s 1800mA battery, which might not be sufficient to support long periods of use.\nLimiting the force magnitude and using components that draw less power may lengthen the untethered use time.\nAlthough we used a VICON optical tracking system to track the device, using inside-out tracking [46] or inertia-sensor based tracking methods [47] would enable the device to be used without any external tracking system installed in the environment.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper introduced Thor's Hammer, an ungrounded force feedback device that can create 3-DOF force feedback. The technical evaluation demonstrated that the device can generate up to 4 N of continuous and precise force feedback in arbitrary directions. The informal user study showed promise in the device, provided insights regarding how users experienced the force feedback, and identified areas for which the device could be improved. Together with the results from the technical evaluation and the user study, we believe that the new device may open up many possibilities in creating more realistic experiences in virtual environments. Due to the 3D printed nature of the device, and its use of off-the-shelf components, the device can be easily replicated and operated without any grounding structures.\nSince the use of propeller propulsion for 3-DOF force feedback had not been investigated prior to this work, our focus was to build a proof-of-concept device. The device currently has several limitations and future work should seek to address them. For instance, while there was no mention of fatigue in the user study, the device is larger and heavier than most VR controllers and a prolonged use could cause fatigue. High latency of the feedback also limits the use of the device to scenarios with gradually changing force feedback. Future work could also include an expansion to a 6-DOF force 1 https://github.com/seongkook/ThorsHammer feedback device by using rotor configurations that support omnidirectional actuation [11] and a more controlled psychophysical study investigating how users perceive the force created by propeller propulsion compared to a grounded force feedback device and the effect of unintended haptic sensations such as vibration and torque on perception of the force.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions and the members of the DGP Lab at the University of Toronto for their valuable feedback.
