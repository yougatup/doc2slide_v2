An interactive design process through C-Space: (a) retrieving design references through graphical user interface; (b) discussing and altering the retrieved references through tangible user interface; (c) testing finishing materials using projection mapping.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The most important spatial design ideas, project principles, and fundamental design decisions are developed in the earliest design phase [16,36]. Spatial design projects such as those of architecture and interior design often begin with the concep tualization that includes abstract diagramming, zoning, and massing to provide a foundation for making design decisions. Specifically, abstract diagrams guide designers to explore al ternative designs without focusing excessively on details [13]. According to Goldschmidt [11], abstraction is a prerequisite to aid design creativity, and it helps designers in transferring only the essential relationships of the design properties. However, ambiguous and incomplete designs can cause communication issues when presented to collaborators. Therefore, designers devote significant amounts of time and resources into search ing for design references and developing rough prototypes to refine their design concepts. The prototyping process also involves communicating design ideas to team members and customers, besides collaborating with other designers [15]. Specifically, in the field of spatial design, the prototyping process is crucial because the design cannot be experienced di rectly until the space is constructed. Hence, designers conduct design explorations to identify better solutions by repeating a quick review via reference searching, conceptualization, and prototyping to address a given design problem. However, three limitations exist for the current design exploration process in spatial design.\nFirst, the lack of a physical model makes it difficult to share spatial information intuitively. According to Chiu [6], design communication is crucial to the design process for facilitating accurate delivery of information. However, abstract diagram sketches in the early stages of design cannot convey the intent of the designer effectively. Moreover, spatial design utilizes 3D models; therefore, communicating it to design collabora tors is difficult, with ambiguous and incomplete 2D representa tions. Second, creating a physical prototype of a spatial design requires time and resources. Physical models facilitate not only the communication to design collaborators and customers, but also the examination of design ideas and decision-making [10]. Additionally, designers utilize prototypes to refine 3D space design concepts [9,10], verify constructability [37], and clarify design credibility [10]. Prototyping is necessary during designing; however, it is time-consuming and resourceintensive, which hinders its potential use as a design aid [10], and a prolonged prototyping process may lead to design fixa tion [44]. Third, traditional design reference search methods are unsuitable for obtaining spatial design data. Spatial design ers must consider various elements such as user requirements, room properties, and connectivity. Currently, designers pri marily use relevant textual terms to search for references. For example, designers use keywords to search for design refer ences via online search engines such as Google and Pinterest; however, spatial design data is multi-type data with visual in formation. Relevant literatures have identified the limitations of textual search [4,7,25,41] as insufficient and fuzzy [1].\nTherefore, this study proposes C-Space, an interactive plat form that assists users in exploring spatial design ideas through a tangible user interface (TUI) and augmented reality (AR). Researchers have developed tools to help users in prototyping the landscape and urban designs through TUI [34,38] but have not provided features for merging previous references to create new designs. Studies based on AR prototyping con centrate on assisting users in creating a working prototype of an AR application [18,19,26,31,32]. Unlike previous studies, we propose an interactive and collaborative platform to create new designs with existing references through AR and prototyping features. The interactive design process through C-Space involves the following steps (please refer to Figure 1): 1) retrieving references, 2) discussing and altering references through projection mapping, 3) prototyping design alterna tives with a TUI. With C-Space, users can collaboratively alter sections of design references to create a new design.\nC-Space has three key features. First, it provides relevant building floor plan references from the database. The system uses building shape, number of rooms, and room connectivity for prioritizing the retrievals. The retrieved references are pro jections mapped on a shared platform. A large-scale dataset (N=13,312) of building floor plans was collected for such refer ence retrieval. Second, it provides a tangible experience to the user and facilitates physical manipulation. According to Kim and Maher [21], TUI and physical actions aid spatial cognition by reducing cognitive load for designers during mental visual reasoning. Furthermore, multi-view user participation enables the interactive and rapid exploration of design alternatives in a collaborative environment. Third, it allows users to assess various finishing materials via projection mapping. Although material testing is typically conducted in the later stages, the system allows material consideration in the early phase. Also, The results of C-Space can be exported in a building informa tion modeling (BIM)-compatible file format. Spatial design projects require multidisciplinary collaboration, necessitating the connection of design knowledge acquired from the early through the later design phases. Thus, the results of C-Space can be seamlessly linked to a later design process.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "RELATED WORKS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Spatial Design Support System for Early Design Phase", "text": "Studies based on spatial design support systems focus on the generation of optimized design variations based on predefined objectives at an early stage [8]. However, it is difficult to establish a clear design objective because the design concept, in the early stage, only exists in an abstract form. Min et al. [28] developed a design support system to aid the early spatial design phase by implementing a rule-based approach. Users input abstract properties, and the system recommends design adjustments. However, such a system requires a set of predefined design rules, and thus, it requires extensive prior research. It is suitable when the designer creates a design with similar constraints and objectives but not ideal in conceptual development with abstract diagrams. Furthermore, objectivebased design-generation methods create design starting points instead of the final design outcome [5]. To the best of our knowledge, the design support system for the early design phase in spatial design, utilizing the abstract intentions of the designer and providing an interface to find appropriate design alternatives, has not been investigated yet [27]. It is crucial to utilize abstraction to enhance the understanding of source properties, which plays a key in aiding design creativity [11]. Therefore, identifying an appropriate design reference from a large number of design alternatives is a challenging task. Thus, we propose three design reference retrieval methods to identify a design reference that meets the design requirements of the user from a large dataset.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Prototyping in Spatial Design", "text": "In spatial design such as architectural design, physical models are utilized to test and refine design ideas [12]. Additionally, architectural designers utilize physical models to communicate and share design ideas [35]. According to Steffanny [43], digi tal models cannot replace physical models for spatial design because the act of creating a physical model itself is the act of recording and interpreting the design, and design decisions can be taken accordingly [47]. Scale is a crucial factor in ar chitectural design [40]. A scaled physical model provides the designer with highly intuitive and clear relationships between spaces in scale. Therefore, imagining space using a scaled physical model is natural for spatial designers. Yaneva [47] explained the importance of the prototyping a physical model by observing the design process of architects in a professional architecture firm. The architects communicated using a phys ical model and refined the design, and during this process, they naturally experienced the space. Physical modeling on a scale with greater accuracy is required to test the relation ship between spaces and their nuances; however, this activity increases time and resource consumption. Testing finishing materials on the prototype further increases the cost. RoomA live [17] transforms any room into immersive experience by projection mapping the digital contents to the planar surfaces like walls and floors. In this respect, AR can be utilized to test various finishing material on design prototypes. Therefore, this study proposes the C-Space, which enables TUI and AR based intuitive modeling and material simulation features such that designers can explore a vast design space.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Tangible User Interface and Design Collaboration", "text": "TUI is an interaction method that affects digital representation through physical manipulation by the user, enabling better understanding and application of data [30]. MiniStudio, pro posed by Kim et al. [20], used miniature models and AR to design ubicomp spaces. Spatiality is an element that is diffi cult to experience without a prototype. MiniStudio enabled designers to better capture the design constraint and domain. Wakita et al. [45] developed SMAAD Surface, a TUI-based tool for prototyping organic forms of architectural mass to help designers in modeling complex shapes intuitively. Another example of the use of TUI in spatial design is the daylight prototyping tool, Heliodon [30], that allows users to under stand daylighting by simulating daylight conditions in built environments using a TUI. Heliodon utilizes TUI to prototype objects that would otherwise be difficult to visualize without physical models. According to Zuckerman and Gal-Oz [49], TUI not only enables intuitive use, but also aids collabora tion. Gu et al. [14] also mentioned that TUI amplifies the effect of design collaboration in the same space by sharing the design changes through tangible interaction. Therefore, applying TUI in spatial design prototyping processes can lead to more intuitive and effective collaborations and improve the understanding of space that designers design.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Design Reference Retrieval", "text": "In the early stages of designing, designers use existing design outcomes as a reference. By exploring similar design cases, they can utilize knowledge from previous examples in current design problems. In this respect, research has been conducted on the development of floor plan retrieval algorithms based on the case-based reasoning (CBR) concept [4,7,23,25,41]. CBR is a concept wherein a novel solution can be obtained by exploring similar problem cases [22]. The most advanced form of CBR for spatial design is the one that uses semantic fingerprints of buildings. Semantic information of buildings refers to the concept of indexing the numbers and functions of rooms and the connectivity and accessibility of each room by using the hierarchical structure of the building data [24]. For example, a.SCatch is a sketch-based tool that retrieves floor plan images similar to the plan values entered by the user [1,46]. They introduced an algorithm for searching similar draw ings using the input sketch values and the method of forming a repository by extracting spatial semantics from existing design references. In contrast, MetisCBR uses multiple agents to provide a description of the search process to the user, along with the retrieved outcome [2,3]. Although the floor plan retrieval method of these state-of-the-art graph-based seman tic fingerprint studies is very powerful, these methods cannot process the floor plan's shape information. In other words, in these methods, similar floor plan drawings can be searched by determining a relationship and functions of spaces, but the shape of the floor plan itself cannot be considered. However, as shape is an important feature of human cognitive activity [48], shape similarity-based floor plan retrieval methods must be developed [42]. Therefore, we propose a novel floor plan search system, and an interface consisting of semantic finger print and shape similarity-based retrieval features to better capture and connect abstract intention entered by the user to a design reference created by other designers.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "C-SPACE", "text": "C-Space is a design support system that stands for \"collab orative space\" and \"see [si:] space.\" It consists of six major components: 1) physical modeling components; 2) design reference data analysis; 3) three design reference retrieval methods and interfaces; 4) material simulation; 5) design al ternative management; 6) export to BIM format.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Physical Modeling Components", "text": "C-Space supports a TUI environment for physical modeling in architectural design, scaled down to 1/30. The physical modeling components consist of modular building blocks, room marker blocks, numbering interface, and grid board. The modular building blocks are used to assemble walls and rooms, and room marker blocks are used to indicate the room types. As illustrated in Figure 2-a, we created three different wall types (20 mm, 40 mm, and 80 mm wide) and three corner types (L, T, and + shaped blocks). A magnet with diameter 3 mm was installed at the bottom of the blocks to prevent them from falling apart. The building blocks have infrared (IR) reflective stickers on the top to enable automatic wall detection. The room markers have color stickers (Figure 2-b). Each color indicates a room type (balcony = green; bathroom = blue; living room = red; entrance = pink; bedroom = yellow). The grid board was made of a steel plate with a total area of 800 mm \u00d7 800 mm (Figure 2-d). A single grid unit measured 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm, and such units were arranged in 25 rows and columns. The unit size in real scale (600 mm) followed the minimum size of human movement [29,33]. The grid board could be rotated 360\u00b0, and the AR marker on the grid board was used to detect the rotational angle to responsively map design reference and finishing material on the rotating grid board in real time. The numbering interface left to the grid board consists of '1', '2', '3', and '4 and more' areas (Figure 2-c).

We collected 13,312 floor plans of residen tial spaces in Seoul from a web-based real-estate database (r114.co.kr) using a custom-written software in Python. A total of 7,555 floor plans with reliable resolutions were used for the study (Figure 3-a). The collected data were analyzed to index semantic information of the floor plans. The floor plan analysis was performed using Python, OpenCV, and NetworkX libraries. As illustrated in Figure 3, first, a morphological trans formation was performed to remove unnecessary contour lines such as text, hatches, and furniture from the drawing images, and only the wall lines were extracted (Figure 3-a). Then, the edge points that share the same x or y coordinates within the specified threshold were drawn, and each room was extracted in the form of a closed polygon. The room type was classified based on the color detected at the center of each room (Figure 3-b) because the source data was already colored according to the room type. Thereafter, room nodes were created in accordance with the number of rooms. The nodes had their own room type as attributes. The room connectivity was deter mined by room nodes and door connection (Figure 3-c). When a room node is connected to a door, which is also connected to another room node, then the edge between the rooms is assigned. Later, the floor plan shape was extracted though shape analysis (Figure 3-d).\nThe bounding box is defined by connecting the outermost corner points of the building silhouette (Figure 4-a, b), and it is used to determine the aspect ratio of the floor plan shape. Thereafter, we divided the bounding box into 16 grids (Figure 4-c). Then, the shape's area occupying ratio for each of the 16 grids was calculated. The floor plans were classified into seven types based on the aspect ratio and the 16 area ratios. The classification criteria are variations of those used by Rodrigues et al. [39] (Figure 4-d). The 16 area ratios also used for the shape-based retrieval method to calculate floor plan similarity. The room location is obtained by converting the room center to its relative position using the horizontal and vertical lengths, as shown in equations 1 and 2. The relative coordinates x and y are calculated by subtracting room center coordinate Rx and Ry from the top left corner coordinates, (Tx,Ty). Then, this result is divided by the difference of the bottom-right corner coordinates, (Bx,By), and (Tx,Ty).\nRelative x = |Rx \u2212 T x| / |Bx \u2212 T x|(1)\nRelative y = |Ry \u2212 Ty| / |By \u2212 Ty| (2)  ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 9}, {"heading": "System Interface", "text": "Figure 5 illustrates the main page of C-Space's GUI.

Additionally, when the corners are correctly recognized, the surface area (m 2 ) is calculated and provided to the user. Unlike other reference retrieval methods, the shape-based method enables users to input the weighting value through the slider GUI to retrieve the floor plan references based on the degree of similarity. The higher the weighting value, the higher the is degree of similarity of the retrieved floor plan (Figure 7-c). The shape-based reference retrieval method is performed in three steps. First, filtering is performed using the shape classification method. Secondly, the references with a similarity degree lower than the weighting value are filtered out.

The purpose of this filtering operation is not to perform graph matching to obtain data identical to the user input but to perform subgraph matching to obtain data including the user input. Therefore, users can retrieve design references that partially match the input room connectivity. Also, the room connectivity-based retrieval method is integrated with the location of the room to sort the retrieved results. This method calculates the sum of distances between the location of the input room and rooms in   the database.

Then, the pre installed IR camera detects the IR Sticker on the building block, and the system reconstructs a digital 3D model of the building block assembly. To achieve this, C-Space detects the corner, outer, and inner walls of the completed model. Corners are detected using an algorithm that distinguishes between the inner and outer walls based on their areas by examining the surrounding eight grids (Figure 11). Then, the order of the corners is sorted to form a continuous line, and the outer walls are automatically assigned between the corners. For accurate modeling, corners are offset by 8 pixels (7.071 mm) to account for the thickness of the wall. The intersection points of three or more walls are set as starting points for the detection of the inner space. The search process begins from a starting point, and inner corners are identified. Then, other corners of the same space are eliminated to prevent redundant searching. Finally, every corner of the inner space is offset by 26 pixels (21.213 mm).\nUsers can select and apply finishing materials by using C Space's GUI (Figure 13-a).

P12 responded, \"It was helpful to be able to search gradually, depending on the input condition.\" P8 said, \"C-Space was timeefficient because the reference search using visual language was simpler and faster than keyword search through Pinterest or Google which is widely used reference search process.\" This was well reflected in the user response regarding the im pact of retrieval on design development (Q6: 6.000, 0.853). Further, evaluating the finishing materials through projection mapping allowed users to explore the variations in materials, determining the overall nuance of the design. The participants agreed that material simulation helps in embodying the design concept. However, it was pointed out that the limitation of C-Space was that the windows and doors cannot be articulated, and the performance of the projector used to simulate the ma terial was sub-optimal. Therefore, the user response regarding the material simulation on design concept development was lower than other performance measures. (Q7: 4.250, 1.712).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Inducing Collaborative Discussion", "text": "We observed that discussions were actively conducted in all the four teams. These discussions accounted for 73% of the entire design experiment in the four teams (Figure 17). The in-depth interviews also revealed that C-Space promoted the collaboration, regardless of the relationships among the partic ipants. P10 said, \"I was working with the stranger, and it was awkward in the tutorial. However, we felt like we were getting closer as if we were assembling modular building blocks to gether like Lego.\" P11 replied, \"It was possible to design and evaluate models together without knowing the personality or working style of team members, so there was no problem in col laboration.\" Thus, C-Space is helpful even when unacquainted people collaborate; it promotes multi-user participation. P7 commented, \"It was good that the design idea led to a physical model, which could be shared and modified directly with the team.\" P10 said, \"Because it is much easier than hand draw ing, anyone can understand it, and it seems to be excellent in communication with non-designers. It was also great to be able to quickly come up with ideas through modeling and instantly modify them.\" We observed users embody design ideas by exploring references in the dataset through C-Space. For example, P10 said, \"I like this reference, but the room is small, let's combine the two rooms or move the porch,\" and the collaborators started to assemble building blocks to test the new designs over the references projected on the grid board. Thus, C-Space motivates multiple users to collaboratively de velop design ideas by modifying retrieved design references partially or entirely during the early design phase.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Integration of Early Design Phase to Later Design Phases", "text": "According to participant responses, the design alternative man agement feature to archive design references and concepts was helpful. P8 and P10 added that this feature could be signifi cantly helpful in the later design phase when designers review previous concepts for reference. Therefore, creating a large set of possible and reliable design alternatives and references was useful to assimilate knowledge acquired from the early design phase to use the same in later design phases. Furthermore, every participant said yes to the question, \"Will the design outcome of the C-Space be exported to a BIM file and run on Autodesk Revit, help with the mid and late design phase?\" P11 said, \"Even when using Revit, there's a big difference between starting with no initial concept, no site and import ing predefined early design concept. The design development process will be much faster by utilizing the C-Space and Revit together.\" P8 replied, \"Because we have defined the fundamen tals of floor plan through the C-Space, we can further develop details like the position of the door in Revit.\" In the spatial design, BIM is a leading technology helping designers in the mid to late design phases. However, designers still utilize tex tual reference search, sketching, and foam boards for the early design phase. Thus, C-Space can be used to assist designers in the early design phase to allow them to achieve better design outcomes in the later phase of design.

The contributions of this study are as follows:\nFirst, we created an interactive platform on the collaborative spatial design exploration; the designers were enthusiastic about using C-Space in their practice. C-Space offers a novel way of exploring design spaces. We believe that C-Space represents a novel contribution in the area of interactive ex ploration of large collections of design references, particularly those with information on spatial layout, connectivity, and shape. Second, C-Space offers a collaborative design platform with the integration of useful features, including design ref erence exploration using AR and prototyping using TUI that could enhance collaborative processes and produce satisfac tory design outcomes. The individual features of C-Space may not be novel, but to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to integrate the features into an intuitive system and enable better optimization of formerly conducted design processes. Thus, C-Space can be an example of an integrated collaborative system that motivates designers to interact with designs.\nHowever, we identified some limitations of the current C-Space; it only supports orthogonal modeling and a single floor building. These limitations can be overcome in further studies. For example, implementation of tabletop-based shapechanging displays can significantly improve the responsive ness and resolution of the model in the process of prototyping.\nFurther, it can resolve the flooring issue, wherein it is difficult to create multiple floors in the current version. Also, the scope of the research can be widened to other types of spaces such as commercial, exhibition, and office spaces. Most importantly, C-Space can be applied to any dataset with spatial layout, con nectivity, and shapes. It can be used in spatial design domains such as urban planning, landscape design, and interior space design for both professional and educational purposes. For future work, C-Space can also be developed as a prototyping tool to design projector-based responsive spaces as RoomA live [17] by adding the AR content information to spatial data.\nWe hope this study inspires future research in this area.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A5A8034285).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Automatic analysis and sketch-based retrieval of architectural floor plans", "journal": "Pattern Recognition Letters", "year": "2014", "authors": "Sheraz Ahmed;
