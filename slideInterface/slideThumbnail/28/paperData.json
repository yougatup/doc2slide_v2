    "text": "ABSTRACT Crowdwork can enable invaluable opportunities for people with disabilities, not least the work fexibility and the ability to work from home, especially during the current Covid-19 pandemic. This paper investigates how engagement in crowdwork tasks is afected by individual disabilities and the resulting implications for HCI. We frst surveyed 1,000 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers to identify demographics of crowdworkers who identify as having various disabilities within the AMT ecosystem—including vision, hearing, cognition/mental, mobility, reading and motor impairments. Through a second focused survey and follow-up interviews, we provide insights into how respondents cope with crowdwork tasks. We found that standard task factors, such as task completion time and presentation, often do not account for the needs of users with disabilities, resulting in anxiety and a feeling of depression on occasion. We discuss how to alleviate barriers to enable efective interaction for crowdworkers with disabilities."

Using crowdwork for user research raises a number of issues, such as a lack of experimental controls, a need to ensure users invest efort in the tasks and a requirement and desire to maintain high research ethics standards [12, 23]. Nonetheless, a series of studies have demonstrated that the results from crowdwork studies are practically indistinguishable from those that use more ‘traditional’ recruitment channels [11, 19, 20, 28, 56]. Other notable crowdwork platforms include Clickworker and Microworkers, although there are numerous such platforms available online."

We explored a variety of the most common disability categories [16], including: cognition/mental, hearing, physical, mobility, visual and motor/dexterity impairments. Out of the 1,000 participants that responded to the frst survey, 626 reported having a disability. We invited a subset of the participants in the frst survey (100 from each disability category) to take part in the second survey, which specifcally focused on the individual disability categories. Following both surveys, we conducted further interviews with 5 participants. We present demographic information on those users who identify as having a disability and discuss the fndings in light of previous work. Furthermore, we discuss how identifed barriers to accessibility can be reduced or alleviated to foster efective crowdwork. Given the increasing adoption of crowdwork as a permanent or supplemental source of income for users, the implications of such an investigation for HCI cannot be overstated. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, our work makes the following contributions to the wider HCI literature:"

      "text": "Crowdsourcing is a relatively new technology for outsourcing work [33, 53, 56] in the form of microtasks to people who are generally known as crowdworkers [3]. Hensel et al. [29] defne crowdworking as the subset of crowdsourcing that involves paid work. Through crowdwork platforms, microtasks (a unit of a task on a crowdwork platform) can be available to thousands of workers from diverse backgrounds and communities. This afords potential benefts for research [1, 12, 27, 35, 38, 41, 58], such as the ability to sample a relatively large number of users from the population, high statistical power and generalizability of results [23, 51]. Nevertheless, in certain cases such crowdwork platforms may be unsuitable for HCI-related experiments [30] due to a lack of experimental controls, means of ensuring user investment in the task and ethics [12, 23]. Popular crowdwork platforms [23] include Clickworker [15] and Mechanical Turk [2], although there are numerous available alternatives. We focus on Mechanical Turk in this paper, not only because of the platform’s popularity [25, 41] and widely known brand association [41], but also due to the fact that it has been extensively studied in the literature [25, 28, 31, 36, 44], including in HCI (e.g. [25, 53]), thereby facilitating a potential for comparison between studies."

Mechanical Turk (also known as AMT or MTurk) is a crowdsourcing platform developed by Amazon in 2005 that allows microtasks to be completed by crowdworkers [46, 48, 53]. A person who posts a microtask on AMT is called a requester, and the crowdworkers are known simply as workers, or ‘Turkers’ (when specifcally referring to AMT workers). In AMT, a microtask is referred to as a Human Intelligence Task (HIT), since these tasks are mostly suitable for human processing, rather than a machine. We use the terminology defned in this section in the rest of the paper."

On the completion of HITs, requesters evaluate the HITs and can either approve or reject them. Approval results in payment, whereas a rejection does not.

Given that this is far below the minimum wage rate in the US, it can lead to unsatisfactory and stressful working conditions [7, 25]. Certain studies have found that income generation is the primary reason many workers engage in crowdwork [8, 25, 45]. Therefore, low compensation presents a problem to many workers [26]. Consequently, workers often resort to strategies, such as using scripts and community support to identify suitable HITs, including those with relatively higher payments [25]."

Although the work by Calvo et al. [10] provided useful insights into how the AMT interface could be improved, there are a number of key opportunities for further work in the HCI domain. First, it is important to understand how AMT crowdworkers perceive accessibility issues and how these issues hinder their efective use of the platform. Second, although heuristic evaluations are a valid commonly used method in HCI, studies have suggested that expert audits of the WCAG guidelines do not meet the threshold of 80% agreement necessary to give a defnitive answer on whether or not guidelines have been met [4, 5]. Therefore, it useful to gain insights into users’ experiences with crowdwork platforms, by engaging in conversations with users."

For instance, 100 participants who reported having visual impairments in Survey 1 completed Survey 2’s general questions section and the visual disability component. Therefore there were 600 total responses for all disability categories. Survey 2 was tailored in this way so that participants only needed to complete a survey that was specifc to their identifed disability. In total, 600 responses were received for all disability categories. General questions were focused the following topics: (1) Reasons for using AMT. (2) Whether earnings from AMT are sufcient for daily living. (3) What AMT HITs are difcult to perform, given the participant’s"

[61] suggest platform holders use metadata to indicate the kinds of abilities that are suitable for HITs; this could work in the case of popular HITs for which it is obvious that certain abilities are essential, for example, having no hearing impairment when doing an audio transcription HIT. However, it is possible that this solution could lead to complications in more nuanced cases, as found in our work. For instance, a requester may need to specify all of the relevant abilities for their HITs, and there are numerous conditions to cater to, some of which the requester may not even be aware of, such as dyscalculia in AI training tasks. Based on our user feedback, we recommend an additional solution where platform holders take responsibility and integrate such fexibility into user profles. For instance, if a worker has a certain disability, as stated in their profle, they do not get penalized if they cannot complete HITs that might be difcult for them in the allocated time. Instead they are given extra time to complete HITs. As a general rule, the approach taken by Prolifc [50] can be considered in AMT—activating the HIT timer only when a worker begins working on the HIT, rather than when the HIT is accepted."

Our interviewees responded in great depth to accessibility issues that they often face as AMT workers, with regard to their disabilities; this provides useful insights into improving accessibility in crowdwork platforms. However, their opinions represent a subset of the potential barriers to usability in crowdwork platforms in the domain of the explored disability categories. We note here that we experienced difculties recruiting participants for the interview. Similar problems are evident in the literature. For example, Sannon and Cosley [54] interviewed 14 regular AMT participants over a 4-month period. The exact factors contributing to low interview uptake are unclear. We conjecture factors such as anonymity and convenience to play a role, based on anecdotal evidence. For instance, crowdworkers can complete HITs in their own time and pace, and the work is relatively anonymous. On the other hand, an interview requires some degree of organization, rigidity and exposure."

This is an opportunity for further work."
