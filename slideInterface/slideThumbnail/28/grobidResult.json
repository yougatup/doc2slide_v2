This paper investigates how engagement in crowdwork tasks is afected by individual disabilities and the resulting implications for HCI. We frst surveyed 1,000 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers to identify demographics of crowdworkers who identify as having various disabilities within the AMT ecosystem-including vision, hearing, cognition/mental, mobility, reading and motor impairments. Through a second focused survey and follow-up interviews, we provide insights into how respondents cope with crowdwork tasks. We found that standard task factors, such as task completion time and presentation, often do not account for the needs of users with disabilities, resulting in anxiety and a feeling of depression on occasion. We discuss how to alleviate barriers to enable efective interaction for crowdworkers with disabilities.\u2022 Human-centered computing \u2192 Empirical studies in accessibility; \u2022 Information systems \u2192 Crowdsourcing.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Crowdwork is a relatively new form of digital labor where crowdworkers complete microtasks posted by a 'requester' in order to earn income [8,61]. Given the fexibility involved in crowdwork and the lack of a need to commute to work, it is unsurprising that crowdwork ofers several advantages for work, which in most cases can be ideal for people with disabilities [61].\nAmazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a popular crowdwork platform, launched by Amazon in 2005, which has seen increasing use as a tool for research, including in social science [48], education [20], natural language processing (NLP) [57] image labelling [53,58] and more [35,38]. Using crowdwork for user research raises a number of issues, such as a lack of experimental controls, a need to ensure users invest efort in the tasks and a requirement and desire to maintain high research ethics standards [12,23]. Nonetheless, a series of studies have demonstrated that the results from crowdwork studies are practically indistinguishable from those that use more 'traditional' recruitment channels [11,19,20,28,56]. Other notable crowdwork platforms include Clickworker and Microworkers, although there are numerous such platforms available online.\nCommon microtasks (known as Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs) performed on AMT include surveys, content generation, audio and video transcription, language translation, information fnding and verifcation and validation. Users can engage in crowdwork using a relatively simple and inexpensive computer connected to the Internet, which is another factor explaining why this type of work has become a viable option for either primary or secondary work [8,61].\nDespite the increasing interest in crowdwork by researchers and users alike, the literature suggests that crowdwork presents several accessibility issues [10,37,39,60,61], which can impact successful engagement in this type of work-examples of which include user interface issues [10], language barriers [37], wages [61], time limits [8,61] and unclear instructions [8]. Despite this body of literature, questions remain unanswered as to how the above issues afect people with a range of disabilities that are most likely to afect computer use. Further, it is important to identify how people with a range of disabilities approach or avoid crowdwork tasks, what role their impairment plays in the successful engagement in crowdwork and their opinions on how these issues may be alleviated.\nIn this paper, we frst conducted two surveys to understand how AMT workers who identify as having a disability cope with performing HITs (microtasks). We explored a variety of the most common disability categories [16], including: cognition/mental, hearing, physical, mobility, visual and motor/dexterity impairments. Out of the 1,000 participants that responded to the frst survey, 626 reported having a disability. We invited a subset of the participants in the frst survey (100 from each disability category) to take part in the second survey, which specifcally focused on the individual disability categories. Following both surveys, we conducted further interviews with 5 participants. We present demographic information on those users who identify as having a disability and discuss the fndings in light of previous work. Furthermore, we discuss how identifed barriers to accessibility can be reduced or alleviated to foster efective crowdwork. Given the increasing adoption of crowdwork as a permanent or supplemental source of income for users, the implications of such an investigation for HCI cannot be overstated. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, our work makes the following contributions to the wider HCI literature:\n(1) An investigation into the demographics of crowdworkers, in the US, who identify as having a disability and use the AMT platform.\n(2) Insights into the factors that hinder the efective completion of crowdwork tasks by people with a variety of difculties and impairments that are most likely to hinder computer use.\n(3) A discussion on how identifed accessibility issues can be alleviated in order to encourage efective participation in crowdwork.", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BACKGROUND 2.1 Crowdwork", "text": "Crowdsourcing is a relatively new technology for outsourcing work [33,53,56] in the form of microtasks to people who are generally known as crowdworkers [3]. Hensel et al. [29] defne crowdworking as the subset of crowdsourcing that involves paid work. Through crowdwork platforms, microtasks (a unit of a task on a crowdwork platform) can be available to thousands of workers from diverse backgrounds and communities. This afords potential benefts for research [1,12,27,35,38,41,58], such as the ability to sample a relatively large number of users from the population, high statistical power and generalizability of results [23,51]. Nevertheless, in certain cases such crowdwork platforms may be unsuitable for HCI-related experiments [30] due to a lack of experimental controls, means of ensuring user investment in the task and ethics [12,23]. Popular crowdwork platforms [23] include Clickworker [15] and Mechanical Turk [2], although there are numerous available alternatives. We focus on Mechanical Turk in this paper, not only because of the platform's popularity [25,41] and widely known brand association [41], but also due to the fact that it has been extensively studied in the literature [25,28,31,36,44], including in HCI (e.g. [25,53]), thereby facilitating a potential for comparison between studies.\n2.1.1 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and Terminology. Mechanical Turk (also known as AMT or MTurk) is a crowdsourcing platform developed by Amazon in 2005 that allows microtasks to be completed by crowdworkers [46,48,53]. A person who posts a microtask on AMT is called a requester, and the crowdworkers are known simply as workers, or 'Turkers' (when specifcally referring to AMT workers). In AMT, a microtask is referred to as a Human Intelligence Task (HIT), since these tasks are mostly suitable for human processing, rather than a machine. We use the terminology defned in this section in the rest of the paper. AMT normally requires certain qualifcations from workers in order to access and complete HITs on the platform [25]. Such qualifcations can range from having a certain number of previous HITs completed to having a 'masters' qualifcation gained by consistently completing HITs of a certain type from a variety of requesters with a high degree of accuracy. On the completion of HITs, requesters evaluate the HITs and can either approve or reject them. Approval results in payment, whereas a rejection does not. If a HIT is accepted but not completed, it is returned.\nMonetary rewards for completing HITs on AMT can be as little $0.01, with a median pay rate at $3.13 [25]. Given that this is far below the minimum wage rate in the US, it can lead to unsatisfactory and stressful working conditions [7,25]. Certain studies have found that income generation is the primary reason many workers engage in crowdwork [8,25,45]. Therefore, low compensation presents a problem to many workers [26]. Consequently, workers often resort to strategies, such as using scripts and community support to identify suitable HITs, including those with relatively higher payments [25].", "n_publication_ref": 42, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Demographics of Crowdworkers on AMT", "text": "Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the demographics of AMT workers [17,53]. Ross et al. [53] estimated more than 400,000 registered workers, with some research placing the worker count at 500,000 [12,40]. It is not known how many of the users are active [12], although US workers were estimated at 15,000 at any given time [21,59]. However, in the interest of the research community, previous work revealed that only 7,300 participate in research studies [59], although Difallah et al. [17] estimate this number to be closer to 2,450 as at 2018. Prior work [42] also suggests that even though recruiting workers with the masters qualifcation provides some quality assurance, there is no marked diference in quality of results between more experienced workers and their less experienced peers.\nOne question that arises at this point is: Who are AMT workers? An informal 2010 investigation [34] suggested that the AMT demographics primarily included workers based in the US who are relatively young, female, educated and with moderately high incomes. Formal studies confrmed this demographic [17,49] but highlight an increase in international workers, mostly from India [17,37].\nThe literature highlights eforts to understand crowdworker demographics with regard to users identifying as having a disability. For example, Zyskowski et al. [61] explore the challenges associated with microtask employment for people with disabilities. They performed a survey with over 600 participants and carried out follow up interviews with 13 respondents. Zyskowski et al. [61] found that a reasonable number of people with disabilities engage in crowdwork. Consequently, they outline a number of avenues for further research, including understanding: a) the level of representation of people with diferent specifc disabilities in crowdwork; and b) the ever-changing demographics (e.g. the elderly) of people with disabilities and the potential dynamics for support within this community. Zyskowski et al. 's work [61] focuses on attitudes of people with disabilities towards crowdwork, regardless of whether or not they actually do engage, or have previously engaged, in crowdwork. In their study, a relatively small subset of participants used AMT. Our work, while similar to [61], difers mainly in the sense that we focus specifcally on AMT and aim to understand the demographics of users with diferent disabilities and how these disabilities afect their engagement in crowdwork on AMT.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Accessibility in Crowdwork", "text": "In an attempt to evaluate the accessibility of AMT from a strict user interface (UI) standpoint, Calvo et al. [10] conducted a heuristic analysis of AMT using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [52]-a set of guidelines for making websites useful and more accessible for users. Calvo et al. [10] found a variety of potential accessibility challenges with the AMT interface (in 2014), which could present barriers to use for those with visual, audio, cognitive and physical disabilities. Although the work by Calvo et al. [10] provided useful insights into how the AMT interface could be improved, there are a number of key opportunities for further work in the HCI domain. First, it is important to understand how AMT crowdworkers perceive accessibility issues and how these issues hinder their efective use of the platform. Second, although heuristic evaluations are a valid commonly used method in HCI, studies have suggested that expert audits of the WCAG guidelines do not meet the threshold of 80% agreement necessary to give a defnitive answer on whether or not guidelines have been met [4,5]. Therefore, it useful to gain insights into users' experiences with crowdwork platforms, by engaging in conversations with users.\nResearchers have conducted such investigations to improve the accessibility of crowdwork for users with low information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. For instance, in 2010, Khanna et al. [37] conducted a study to evaluate the usability of AMT interfaces for low-income workers in India. They proposed design recommendations based on the fact that the interfaces for HITs were often too complicated for these users, especially regarding the English language. Furthermore, a 2013 study by Kobayashi et al. [39] developed a question-answer card interface to allow low ICT-literate elderly users in Japan to participate in crowdwork with minimal efort.\nCertain disabilities are often associated with aging, and prior work has investigated barriers to efective participation in crowdwork in older adults. For instance, Brewer et al [8] report that older adults are more likely to engage in crowdwork, if certain accessibility issues, such as 'unfair' time limits and unclear instructions, are revised. Zyskowski et al. [61] also highlight accessibility issues involving people with disabilities who engage in crowdwork, and they suggest strategies for assisting such users, who may be unaware of crowdwork, in fnding opportunities in this space.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESEARCH OBJECTIVES", "text": "Most of the important works in the literature have investigated general accessibility in crowdwork, which provides an essential starting point for our work. To address the gaps in the literature, we set out to achieve the objectives below. We focus on AMT workers based in the US in order to compare demographics with existing research in this area (e.g. [61]) and the US Census Bureau [9].\n(1) Investigate the demographics of users who identify as having a disability and who regularly engage in crowdwork on AMT. (2) Identify how these users are limited by their individual disabilities and how accessibility issues identifed in the literature may be exacerbated given specifc disabilities, such as cognition/mental, vision, hearing, reading and motor/dexterity. (3) Discuss design implications for the AMT platform and HITs, based on our research fndings, in order to enable efective use of the platform by people with disabilities.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": "Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted two surveys and follow-up interviews with survey respondents. Both surveys were administered over a three-week period in the summer of 2020 and were presented to participants as HITs on the AMT platform. The frst survey was a general survey to gain insights into user demographics, including any existing disabilities. The title of the HIT indicated that it was a survey on accessibility in crowdwork. We expected this HIT to attract people who identify as having a disability, in addition to non-disabled people who just wanted to complete the HIT. We then targeted participants who responded in the afrmative in the frst survey as having at least one disability and invited them privately to participate in the second survey, which was only made available to eligible respondents from Survey 1. Note that there was no initial indication in Survey 1 that the participants would be completing another HIT for a further survey. The second survey was a focused survey to gain insights into barriers to the successful completion of HITs based on users' existing disabilities. A secondary beneft for conducting a second focused survey was to eliminate potential bias due to misrepresentation, sometimes done by crowdworkers in order to qualify for a HIT [55] in the competitive crowdwork sphere. We performed consistency checks on the survey results to identify unusual patterns of answers and to confrm that there was a set of sufciently diverse answers [3,23]. Open-ended questions from the focused survey and transcribed interview responses were analyzed using a hybrid process of inductive and deductive thematic analysis methods to develop concepts, themes and interpretations based on the data [13,18]. We frst used a deductive approach to identify data patterns that were relevant to the disability themes of interest to our work. We then used open coding [47] to explore the qualitative data to allow for the discovery of emergent themes, which we had previously not identifed [61].\nPayments for most HITs on AMT are typically low (average of about $2/hr [25]). Our surveys were designed to meet the US federal minimum wage ($7.25/hr) and were presented as separate HITs with $0.25 and $0.20 rewards for Surveys 1 and 2 respectively.

(yes, no) To target those participants who may experience accessibility issues when using the AMT platform, we invited participants who responded 'yes' to the binary questions and who responded with 1-4 in the scale-based questions to take part in Survey 2.

For instance, 100 participants who reported having visual impairments in Survey 1 completed Survey 2's general questions section and the visual disability component. Therefore there were 600 total responses for all disability categories. Survey 2 was tailored in this way so that participants only needed to complete a survey that was specifc to their identifed disability. In total, 600 responses were received for all disability categories.

I don't know if Amazon cares to make any changes to it. \" P1 (male, 35, cognition) 7.8.3 Tools. We already highlighted, in our study fndings, user frustration regarding fnding HITs that ofer a reasonable income reward. In response to these problems, several tools, such as Turk-erView, HIT Catcher and MTurk Suite, have emerged, which allow workers to manage their AMT account and fnd reasonable HITs. Based on interviewee feedback these tools have become an essential part of their crowdwork workfow.\n\"TurkerView could give you the requester name, the HIT title, it flls in the wage data, how long it took me to complete it; it has fve ratings where I could go from underpaid to generous, and it lets me fll in how much per hour that HIT got me \"MTurk Suite is great, and when I found that, I said 'this is awesome, it will auto search for things and I will tell it any time this HIT from particular requester comes in, grab it for me', I will spend more time working and less time searching. \" P1 (male, 35, cognition) \"Maybe if [Amazon] can build their own HIT Finder and HIT Catcher, that will be the best thing that they can do really.

In addition to tools, as highlighted above, community support is also essential to gaining an advantage as a crowdworker on AMT. For instance, P2 comments on the importance of communities for learning about tools that could give them advantage in crowdwork.\n\"If you join communities and take some time to learn the platform with these tools, it could be very, very lucrative.

Our fndings are consistent with the literature in the sense that the average worker is relatively young, educated and employed [17,25,34,49]. However, in our study there seems to be a higher representation of males (57.8%), compared to the higher representation of females indicated in the literature (70% in 2009 [34] and 50+% more recently in 2018 [17,26]), although this could be indicative of the fact that more males responded to the topic of our research in the frst survey HIT.\nOur fndings are also consistent with the literature [26] as we found that, although income was an important reason for participating in crowdwork, AMT workers also do crowdwork for a variety of other reasons such as keeping productive, performing enjoyable tasks and contributing to research. Income was not seen as sufcient for most HITs [25,26] with most survey respondents using crowdwork as a supplemental source of income. However, our participants use tools, such as MTurk Suite, HIT Finder and Turkernator to identify high income HITs and manage their crowdwork workfow.

Two thirds of the respondents from our frst survey reported having at least one disability, or difculty using a computer, thereby presenting potential barriers to completing crowdwork tasks. This has signifcant implications for HCI, and it is not possible to exhaust all of the issues in a single piece of work. Nevertheless, we highlight the key issues as they relate to the individual disability categories.\nOur work echoes the fndings from previous work [61] that the allocated time for crowdwork tasks (or HITs) can be a signifcant barrier for crowdworkers, resulting in increased anxiety and a feeling of depression if HITs cannot be completed in time. In numerous cases, the need for additional time is essential given the limitations aforded by disabilities, such as motor/dexterity or cognition/mental. Key contributors to anxiety include the repercussions of failing to complete HITs on worker reputation, which afects future opportunities for work on the platform.\nA relatively high number of respondents in Survey 2 (37% to 77%) indicated that they encountered some sort of difculty when completing HITs on AMT, due to their disability. Workers with motor/dexterity impairments reported the highest occurrence in this regard (77%), which supports the study by Lund et al. [43] that found physical disabilities to be the most prevalent category. We note in the fndings that most of the issues are also applicable to the general population, for example, wages, HIT completion time, ambiguity regarding qualifcations and the user interface. However, the fact that these issues can be signifcantly exacerbated due to the presence of disabilities, as we report through our fndings, is noteworthy, and this is an important starting point towards improving the design of crowdwork platforms.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Implications for Design", "text": "In our third research objective, we sought to discuss implications for the design of crowdwork platforms and tasks, to enable efective use by people who have disabilities.

We suggest that crowdwork platform holders, such as Amazon, streamline the workfow for microtasks, to reduce worker inequities in crowdwork.\nTo mitigate the above issues, we frst suggest that crowdwork platform holders (e.g. Amazon) ensure that instructions are clear, to reduce confusion and promote usability. To mitigate the risk of overloading the user interface, information can be contextualized based on user preferences and relevance. Further, we suggest that suitable warnings are issued on AMT in cases where sensitive material exists-for instance, HITs that discuss suicide ideation (for workers who have a history in this regard) and HITs that involve heavy numerical data (for workers who sufer from dyscalculia).\nSecond, et al. [61] suggest platform holders use metato indicate the kinds of abilities that are suitable for HITs; this could work in the case of popular HITs for which it is obvious that certain abilities are essential, for example, having no hearing impairment when doing an audio transcription HIT. However, it is possible that this solution could lead to complications in more nuanced cases, as found in our work. For instance, a requester may need to specify all of the relevant abilities for their HITs, and there are numerous conditions to cater to, some of which the requester may not even be aware of, such as dyscalculia in AI training tasks. Based on our user feedback, we recommend an additional solution where platform holders take responsibility and integrate such fexibility into user profles. For instance, if a worker has a certain disability, as stated in their profle, they do not get penalized if they cannot complete HITs that might be difcult for them in the allocated time. Instead they are given extra time to complete HITs. As a general rule, the approach taken by Prolifc [50] can be considered in AMT-activating the HIT timer only when a worker begins working on the HIT, rather than when the HIT is accepted.\nThird, in the case of AMT, Amazon should also clarify for workers how to achieve qualifcations, such as the masters, since this is necessary to access higher-paying HITs. One way to do this is to provide some indication of how much progress a worker has made towards achieving certain qualifcations. This could potentially encourage workers to perform more HITs in order to become more qualifed on the platform. 8.3.2 Implementing Useful Functionality. Our survey respondents heavily relied on external tools and scripts to assist them in managing their HITs, for example, fnding and tracking reasonable HITs from reputable requesters.

Calvo et al. [10], in their 2014 heuristic evaluation of the AMT interface, noted several heuristic violations which could have implications for usability.

Our interviewees responded in great depth to accessibility issues that they often face as AMT workers, with regard to their disabilities; this provides useful insights into improving accessibility in crowdwork platforms. However, their opinions represent a subset of the potential barriers to usability in crowdwork platforms in the domain of the explored disability categories. We note here that we experienced difculties recruiting participants for the interview. Similar problems are evident in the literature. For example, Sannon and Cosley [54] interviewed 14 regular AMT participants over a 4-month period. The exact factors contributing to low interview uptake are unclear. We conjecture factors such as anonymity and convenience to play a role, based on anecdotal evidence. For instance, crowdworkers can complete HITs in their own time and pace, and the work is relatively anonymous. On the other hand, an interview requires some degree of organization, rigidity and exposure.\nThird, due to the focus of our work, we explored a set of disability dimensions which are likely to impact computer use [16].
