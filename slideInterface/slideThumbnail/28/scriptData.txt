 Hello everyone and thank you for attending this talk. On behalf of my co-authors, Jason, John, and Per Ola, I am Stephen, and I am here to present our work on investigating the accessibility of  crowd work tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
 Mechanical Turk, or AMT, is a crowd work platform developed by Amazon, in 2005, that allows microtasks, also known as Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs, to be completed by crowd workers. Key advantages of crowd work include the  ability to work from home on relatively
 small tasks and at any time and  place with an internet connection. Given these benefits of crowd work, it  can be attractive to people who identify
 as having a disability, as people  can work at their own pace and with any potential assistive devices that  they use on their personal computers. However few works have investigated  accessibility issues in crowd work
 and how these may be overcome. In our study, we had three main objectives: 1.  Investigate the demographics of crowd workers in
 the U.S who identify as having a disability, and use the AMT platform. 2. Gain insights into the factors that hinder the effective  completion of crowd work tasks. 3. Identify how accessibility issues may be alleviated in order to encourage effective participation in crowd work. To achieve these objectives we carried out two surveys and follow-up interviews with AMT workers.
 In Survey 1, we surveyed 1 000  participants using a HIT on AMT to gather basic demographics of users. In  Survey 2, we surveyed only respondents from Survey 1, who identified as having a disability.  We then conducted interviews with 5 participants from survey 2 to gain further insights  into accessibility issues in crowd work. Here are the results on the  number of people that identify as having at least one disability  in Survey 1. The highest number
 were from people who had problems with  dexterity when using a mouse or keyboard. Here the findings on age, race,  gender, and education distribution.
 Similar to previous work on AMT, we find a  relatively young and educated demographic. Further investigations in Survey 1 revealed that a majority of people are employed either on a full-time or part-time basis and that most of the respondents work between five and 35 hours a week.
 Although there are a variety of  HITs that are completed on AMT, our findings show that surveys are  the most completed type of HIT.

 In Survey 2 we found that a high number  of respondents use crowd work because it allows them to work from home, although other key reasons exist, such as: earning a living,
 supplemental income. and just enjoying doing these tasks. Regarding time to complete HITs, this has been identified as  an issue in previous research. In our work, it was a key issue for 43 of the  respondents. Even for people without disabilities,
 time can be a problem but the problem can  be exacerbated by existing disabilities. We can see the number of people in each disability category that reported having difficulties completing HITs on AMT, specifically as a result of their disability. In all cases, the number is
 close to half, which shows a high unfulfilled  need for many participants with disabilities. We cannot cover all of the issues  that we found in this presentation, but please refer to the paper for information on perceived anxiety and depression, qualifications,
 wages and income, goals, UI issues, hits  performed, and hits avoided due to disabilities.
 We discuss improving accessibility in greater detail in the paper. Here are some key design
 implications that follow from Survey 2 and  the interview discussion. 1. To mitigate the
 risk of overloading the UI, information can be  contextualized based on user preferences and relevance. Metadata can be used to indicate the kinds of abilities that are suitable for HITS. This could work in the case of popular HITs, for which it is obvious that certain abilities are essential. 2. AMT workers rely on external tools and scripts to assist them in managing HITs. For example, finding and tracking reasonable HITs that suit certain abilities from reputable requesters.
 This functionality can be implemented in crowd work platforms to assist users, especially those with disabilities. 3. The participants identified potential barriers to usability such as presenting too much information and using relatively small interface elements; for instance, buttons and hyperlinks. Platform holders should ensure revised UIs based on user testing. 4. Communities offer
 essential support to AMT workers by highlighting useful information on available tools, tips, and social benefits. Platform holders  can promote and recommend communities,
 such as Turker Nation and MTurk Suite, especially to new workers. Furthermore, communities can, perhaps, make more of an effort to reach out  to new workers or workers with disabilities. That concludes our presentation. We would like to thank you all for listening  and welcome any questions.
