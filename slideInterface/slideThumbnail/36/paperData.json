    "text": "ABSTRACT Couples exhibit special communication practices, but apps rarely offer couple-specific functionality. Research shows that sharing streams of contextual information (e.g. location, motion) helps couples coordinate and feel more connected. Most studies explored a single, ephemeral stream; we study how couples’ communication changes when sharing multiple, persistent streams. We designed Lifelines, a mobile-app technology probe that visualizes up to six streams on a shared timeline: closeness to home, battery level, steps, media playing, texts and calls. A month-long study with nine couples showed that partners interpreted information mostly from individual streams, but also combined them for more nuanced interpretations. Persistent streams allowed missing data to become meaningful and provided new ways of understanding each other. Unexpected patterns from any stream can trigger calls and texts, whereas seeing expected data can replace direct communication, which may improve or disrupt established communication practices. We conclude with design implications for mediating awareness within couples."

Scissors et al. [47] show how couples switch back and forth between diverse channels to strategically mediate conflicts. Cramer and Jacobs [18] describe how couples intentionally leverage specific characteristics of diverse apps to adapt to each other’s routines or add meaning to their messages: one app can become the “working hours” channel and another the “leisure”; importance or urgency can be conveyed by sending the same message via multiple apps; and a minimalist Yo signal [3] can mean “I’m thinking about you”. Despite these couple-specific communication practices and needs, they end up largely using the same technology as everyone else.While there is a wealth of different commercial communication apps they can choose from, these rarely offer functionality tailored to their special communication practices and intimate knowledge of each other. Communication as imagined by these technologies is two partners intentionally sending discrete (multimedia) messages back and forth, and a mediated relationship is represented as a vertical log of that data within a single app. HCI literature has explored a more expansive view of couple communication, providing partners with diverse types of data about each others’ context when apart [23]. Researchers have mediated awareness by streaming different forms of contextual information, such as location [5], motion [9] or ambient sound [32]. By leveraging"

However, these studies are limited in that they have focused on a single stream of contextual information, exploring how one type of data could be valuable for couples’ communication. Bentley and Metcalf [9] speculate that the fusion of multiple streams may provide value, by sparking conversations and providing richer awareness than any stream taken alone [9]. Secondly, most previous work supports awareness via ephemeral streams of contextual information, which communicate only live data. We speculate that persistent streams communicate richer information by revealing the duration and sequence of activities."

We deploy Lifelines in the wild to generate empirical results about changes in couples’ communication behaviour and inspire the design of future communication apps beyond the homogeneous landscape currently available. We first review the related work on mediated communication for couples and close relationships, we then present the design and development of the Lifelines probe, and lastly report on the insights from a one month field study with nine co-located couples. We conclude with directions for future research and implications for the design of future communication technologies for couples."

While lack of openness and trust may lead to monitoring behaviours [35, 52], couples that trust each other respect the need for privacy: having access to the other’s data and devices does not imply its use [26]. Research also shows how couples hold parallel, mediated conversations on diverse topics [4], leave video-calls running in the background to feel each other’s presence when apart [39, 40], share devices [26] and accounts on social media [55], and repurpose emoji with their own meanings [54]."

      "text": "Technologies for mediating awareness within couples and close relationships Most commercial communication systems focus on the explicit and intentional exchange of messages. By sharing small, casual messages throughout the day [16, 42], close relationships try to create a sense of connected presence [30]. However, this type of communication requires symmetrical engagement between partners, risking a loss of connected presence when one person is unable to respond [30]. Technologies that mediate awareness try to address this loss of connection and instead create “a feeling of relatedness without direct communication” [23] by implicitly sharing presence cues between partners (e.g. music playing or ambient sounds [32]): this supports connectedness even when one partner cannot communicate explicitly [30] or during “empty moments\" [32], i.e. times when one partner is involved in a mundane activity, such as queuing or riding the bus and misses their partner’s presence. Previous work explored diverse streams of contextual information for mediating awareness, e.g. location cues [5, 12]; travel time to a contact’s location [8]; drinking moments through a connected cup [15]; playing music [7, 32]; ambient sounds [32]; appointments in a calendar [49], in-chat heart rate visualizations [24]; and motion in front of a camera [44, 45] or between locations [9]."

For example, location [5], motion (“moving”, “not moving”) [9], playing music [7], and heart rate information [24] correlate with increased feelings of connectedness, provide peace of mind (i.e., knowing that their partners were safe and sound), and signal availability. Heart rate [24] and music [7] also spark conversations about partners’ contexts. At the same time, other studies suggest that location and motion cues reduce direct communication, because partners consult the shared data rather than calling or texting about micro-coordination, i.e. “the exchange of information that allows for the on-going but mundane maintenance of everyday life” [31]. Most of the above research explores ephemeral streams, as do most commercial applications that share live location information (e.g. Life360, Couple and FindMyFriends). Hassib et al. [24] compared both ephemeral and persistent modes of sharing heart rate information within text conversations and described how most participants preferred and felt more"

As described in Figure 2: home and steps communicate different nuances of physical activity and displacement, potentially signaling keymoments of partners’ routines (e.g. leaving for work, lunch breaks or errands); battery shows the power status of the device and may help partners explain missed calls or reveal traces of phone usage habits; media shows any sound activity and reveals diverse activities and habits such as listening to music, watching videos, or alarms; and calls and sms visualize traces of past direct communication that may help contextualize the other streams. We selected these streams based on two criteria: a) the data should help users infer their partner’s actions and phone status; and b) the data should be easy to capture on both iPhone and Android phones. A lifeline visualizes all streams as a stack of layers (Figure 3) to meet three design goals: a) to showmultiple streams in a compact way rather than allocating space for each; b) to help partners infer context from multiple streams simultaneously as well as from individual streams; and c) to allow partners to toggle streams on and off without hurting the aesthetics of the visualization."

We ask the participants to share their screen so we can see how they point at particular areas of their historical lifelines as they describe specific situations. We ask about their favorite, least favorite, or most surprising episodes with Lifelines. We probe for moments where Lifelines affected their (mediated) communication, their favorite and least favorite stream to share and to see from their partners, and motivations behind changes in the customization of their lifelines. We use changes in their lifeline designs, technology breakdowns, and toggling of data streams as moments of interest, around which we ask them to explain why something was significant, why they made that decision, or how it affected their communication with their partners."

He was happily surprised when she asked about his media use: “She saw on my lifeline that I was playing media a lot, and she asked me what it was. And it was because I had installed one of those farming games. And then she installed it, and now we’re both playing. (...) The game created a new bond. So now we have this new conversation topic”. Inez used steps and media as conversation starters: “I can ask him “Where are you? What are you doing? I can see that you’re walking”. So it did improve the communication because I have these small hints”. Similarly but inverted, the surprising absence of calls and sms triggered participants to reach out to one another: “You look at the lifeline and you say ‘oh, there are no calls, no messages’ and that encourages you to text him or call him” Dory."

For example, Dory used media to ask her partner about surprising patterns (trigger), but Kelly used it to implicitly coordinate pick-ups (replace).

Previouswork extensively discussed how sharing contextual information supports micro-coordination without direct communication (e.g. [9]) and how it helps increase feelings of connectedness and reassurance between partners (e.g. [5, 24], see review in [23]). While our results largely echo the literature, an exception stood out: Hugo felt less connected to his partner because he missed her “checking on you” messages: “just by sending a message, it was a closer act than checking the app without talking to the other”. This prompted Hugo to hypothesize that “home is the most significant factor that takes place instead of sending a message”, so he turned it off as a test (Figure 6). Hugo’s partner noticed his home was missing and felt he was hiding something. She asked about this change, and Hugo explained that he turned his GPS off “to save battery”—since disabling the GPS and turning off home result in the same visualization, Lifelines offered Hugo plausibile deniability in this situation [29]."

On the one hand, we had difficulty recruiting participants, with some candidates explicitly saying the idea was “creepy”. On the other hand, the people that did participate raised no overarching significant privacy concerns, and some wanted to share even more diverse data. Opposite to concerns about monitoring behaviour in the literature [5, 9, 24, 34], we found that our participants were generally quite open with each other. A few participants showed concerns about their privacy regarding us—the research team— rather than their partners. Pete explained: “I was just concerned about the server and whether that information was stored somewhere... but not about her”. Our participants wanted their partners to use Lifelines, e.g., to replace asking where they were or what they were doing, which echos findings by Schildt et al. [46]. We also found that participants expected their partners to look at their lifelines as an expression of caring: Mona and John felt reassured by thinking that if anything bad happened to them while commuting, their partners would know. Lucy even felt disappointed at her partner because he checked Lifelines less often than her. The most contrasting example to concerns about monitoring behaviour was a participant that shared her information for her partner’s sake, having no interest in his data: “I rarely look at the phone. So for me, Lifelines doesn’t add too much value. But I think it’s valuable for him. If I arrive too late, he gets worried, he texts me and I don’t even look at the phone. So this gives him information about whether I’m still in class, or if I’m heading home” (Nina). We did find individual differences in privacy concerns around specific individual streams. For example, many suggested unpacking media into more revealing streams: “Right now media doesn’t show exactly what I’m doing. I want to show him if I’m chilling, relaxing, watching Youtube videos or Spotify” (Amy). On the other hand, others felt that media was, at times, too revealing, e.g. Owen felt embarrassed on a day he overslept, as media revealed an alarm snoozing pattern. Similarly, Mona explained that while commuting, she"

We suspect that our participants were largely from the unconcerned category. For example, Fay and her partner shared their exact location and battery level with Zenly in addition to using Lifelines. Some participants fit better in the pragmatists category. For example, Barry had concerns about media and steps, but decided to share them to show his commute patterns. Fundamentalists are probably less likely to want to share any contextual information with their partners. Some of the people who chose not to participate in our study are almost surely from this category."

While our sample of 9 couples does capture diverse cultures, representing different parts of Europe, North and Latin America, and Asia, it does have limitations. All our couples are middle-class and heterosexual. Perhaps most importantly, participants were self-selected, so they all had at least a degree of comfort sharing contextual data with their partners from the outset. Lifelines is not intended for all couples—it is a technology probe for studying how multiple, persistent streams affect the communication dynamics of couples that feel comfortable sharing contextual data. Designers and researchers should be aware it is likely that our sample—and thus our results— are biased in favour of people who have little privacy concerns and thus were happy to participate. While our data lacks examples of deliberate misuse, future work should consider how to mitigate the potential abuse of context data in cases of intimate partner violence [20, 21]. Since mitigating digital abuse via privacy settings may trigger other forms of violence [37], context-data sharing technologies may have to restrict their streams to ambiguous representations that support plausible deniability."

Rotating through new streams periodically can also help maintaining partners’ interest in each other’s data, as they may find less surprises from the same streams over time.

We presented Lifelines, a technology probe that shares up to six persistent streams of contextual data in a peripheral display within a smartphone, allowing each partner to choose among home, battery, media, steps, sms and calls. In a one-month field study with nine couples, we found that partners used the multiplicity of streams to infer diverse activities from their lifelines by looking at individual streams throughout the day, or by combining streams together to obtain more precise meaning. We also observed that, regardless the type of data shared, streams that challenged a partner’s knowledge of the other triggered direct communication, and streams that confirmed a partner’s knowledge of the other replaced direct communication. This introduced new communication dynamics that most leveraged to coordinate tasks implicitly, find reassurance, and feel more connected.We also found that a poor balance between triggering and replacing direct communication can lead to feeling more distant rather than more connected. Sharing persistent streams revealed patterns of missing data, from which partners obtained extra contextual information. Accessing past data also helped partners be more understanding with each other. We encourage further research on combining streams of alternative types of data, mixing persistent and ephemeral representations, and helping partners find the right selection streams that balances their needs for triggering and replacing direct communication over time."
