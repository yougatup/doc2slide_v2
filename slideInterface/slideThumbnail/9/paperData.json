    "text": "ABSTRACT For 15% of the world population with disabilities, accessibility is arguably the most critical software quality attribute. The ever-growing reliance of users with disability on mobile apps further underscores the need for accessible software in this domain. Existing automated accessibility assessment techniques primarily aim to detect violations of predefned guidelines, thereby produce a massive amount of accessibility warnings that often overlook the way software is actually used by users with disability. This paper presents a novel, high-fdelity form of accessibility testing for Android apps, called Latte, that automatically reuses tests written to evaluate an app’s functional correctness to assess its accessibility as well. Latte frst extracts the use case corresponding to each test, and then executes each use case in the way disabled users would, i.e., using assistive services. Our empirical evaluation on real-world Android apps demonstrates Latte’s effectiveness in detecting substantially more useful defects than prior techniques."

Common across all these tools is the way they aim to identify accessibility issues in terms of predefned rules derived from accessibility guidelines. For instance, whether a label for an icon is missing, whether there is suffcient contrast between text and background, whether the actionable elements are too close to each other, etc. While it is important for developers to follow these guidelines in the construction of their apps, the rules by themselves are not able to precisely determine the diffculties a user with disability may experience. For example, from a disabled user’s standpoint, there is a signifcant difference between accessibility issues affecting the main functionalities of an app versus those affecting its incidental functionalities (e.g., advertisement banners, copyright disclaimers), yet the existing techniques provide no effective means of distinguishing between the two. Prior studies [1] have shown the developers tend to either not utilize or simply ignore the results of existing accessibility analysis tools, because they produce a massive amount of accessibility warnings, many of which are minor, or simply wrong. A user study on web accessibility [21] indicates that half of the problems that people with disabilities encounter are not covered by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [26]."

A widely adopted practice in software development is for developers to write system tests, often in the form of Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests, to validate the important use cases (functionalities) of an app for correctness. These use cases are the important functionalities of an app that should also be accessible. Given an app under test and a set of regular GUI tests (written by developers) as input, Latte frst extracts a Use-Case Specifcation corresponding to each test. A Use-Case Specifcation defnes the human-perceivable steps a test takes to exercise a particular functionality in an app. Latte then executes the Use-Case Specifcation using an assistive service, i.e., TalkBack and SwitchAccess. If a use case cannot be completed using an assistive service, it naturally means the corresponding use case has an accessibility problem, which is reported to the developer."

In the case of a shopping app, for instance, creating an account, searching for a product, and purchasing a product, are examples of use case. As a common development practice, developers write GUI tests to automatically evaluate the correctness of a software system’s use cases. A GUI test is a sequence of steps, where in each step, the test (1) locates a GUI element, and (2) performs an action on that element. For example, the frst step (line 1) in Listing 1 locates an element with resource-id equal to com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button and then clicks on it. GUI tests need to uniquely identify elements on the screen. They leverage the implementation details of an app, such as resource-id, to interact with the GUI elements of the app. A GUI test thus follows a white-box approach, i.e., uses the implementation details of an app to drive the execution. Although this format is quite effective for machine execution, it differs vastly from how users interact with an app. A user may exercise the same use case as a test, but follows a black-box approach, i.e., interacts directly with the UI elements of an app to drive the execution."

The reason behind hiding the menu is to improve the user experience by providing more space in the middle list (where a sighted user is looking for an item). However, this change in the layout makes the bottom menu inaccessible for a blind user, since she does not know the menu has disappeared. The accessibility failures in TripIt and Dictionary apps belong to this category.

For example, in the TodoList app, the calendar widget has 30 items in the grid that need to be visited before reaching to “CANCEL” or “OK” buttons (Figure 4(b)). To fx this, developers can provide different layouts for different settings, e.g., a text-based date picker when TalkBack or SwitchAccess are enabled."

However, assistive services cannot analyze web elements properly, as shown earlier in the case of Non-Standard Implementation category of accessibility failures. Even if improper usage of web elements does not make an app inaccessible, it can degrade the user experience. For example, in the case of Dictionary app, shown in Figure 4(c), the defnition of a term is shown in terms of a series of web elements, and each word in the passage is a clickable Android GUI element. Consequently, TalkBack and SwitchAccess need to navigate through all of these elements to reach the end of the text."

It reuses tests written by developers to evaluate the correctness of the important use cases in their apps to also validate the accessibility of those use cases. Latte frst extracts use cases corresponding to an app’s tests, and subsequently executes them with the help of assistive services. We evaluated the effectiveness of Latte by analyzing 20 apps selected from 13 different categories from Google Play and identifed 32 accessibility failures that could not be identifed using the state-ofthe-art technique. A qualitative analysis of the results obtained in our experiments allowed us to identify a number of interesting categories of accessibility failures and warnings, together with ways in which developers can resolve them."

Moreover, we plan to conduct user studies to gain a deeper understanding of the accessibility issues that Latte cannot detect. Therefore, Accessibility Scanner cannot be replaced completely by Latte, rather they complement each other. Our current work focuses on two assistive services and two gestures, clicking and typing. Our future research entails extending Latte to handle additional assistive services and more complex gestures. The version and settings of assistive services may improve or degrade the accessibility of the apps; consequently, our experiments may be affected by them. In future work, we would like to study the impact of settings of assistive services, which may be used by advanced users, on the accessibility of apps. Our eventual goal is to develop an extensible framework capable of identifying a broad list of accessibility issues that can be incorporated into app developers’ workfow seamlessly."
