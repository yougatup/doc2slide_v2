 hello everyone my name is selen turkay on behalf  of my co-authors I will briefly talk about our paper on virtual reality esports. You are probably  familiar with virtual reality which allows users
 to have simulated experiences that can be  similar or different to real-world experiences. In the past several years VR, once again  became popular thanks to the cheap consumer great VR hardware and increasing number of  software including training simulations in
 various fields and VR games such as Beat Saber.  Another field which grew exponentially in the last
 decade is esports. Esports is a hugely successful  and popular form of interactive entertainment. It is often described as competitive online gaming  and involves both professional and amateur players.
 VR esports combine multiplayer competitive gaming  with physical movements afforded by VR technology. Although VR esports has been around for the past several years we know very little on VR esports players' experiences with these  games and what makes a good VR esports game In our exploratory study we aimed to start filling  this gap, building on the prior research on
 player experiences, affordances of vr and exergames, we aim to understand players attitudes towards vr esport games and their experiences  with a representative vr esports game
 due to time constraints i will only present  some of the findings on one research question how do competitive vr esports players experience vr esports?
 we recruited eight professional or semi-professional cs go players to participate  in this study participants knew each other and played cs go together in the past none of  the participants had any prior vr esports experience and had minimum vr experience.
 our study had three phases including one-on-one pre-interviews team-based vr esports gameplay and the focus group post interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed in verbatim. Our  team analyzed the data using thematic analysis.
 participants in teams of four played a first  person shooter vr esports game called soul raiders they played the game for two times at a local vr game arcade called zero latency our game consisted of one one game consisted of best of best out  of three rounds, each played on different map. Objectives include controlling a point on the  map or having the highest number of kills within a set time. here are some highlights from the  findings players found the game quite immersive they especially noted the embodied and spatial  aspects of the game which allowed them to use

 bodily movements such as dodging and crouching or  hiding behind virtual virtual walls as strategies. During the matches participants immersion was  observed in their movements and communication whereby they were seen to shout comments at each  other while moving around the arena crouching leaning or walking swiftly.
 Participants wanted  to have higher interaction fidelity from the game. They thought that having props in the free  roaming arena to help with the constraints of the game would improve their enjoyment. They  also wanted to have enhanced haptic feedback and to be able to manipulate virtual objects in the  game. The heights of the player avatars in the game reflected their actual height and that  was sometimes advantageous as a short player avatar can crouch and hide easily, whereas a tall  player avatar could be seen and targeted easily.
 Participants also talked about equipment and  technology they used. They wished for better functioning gun props to improve their immersion  in the game. They discussed the need for accurate tracking on the physical props such as  guns for their positive game experiences. One of the major problems they had was with  the bandwidth. While the first game session that they played had no technical problems, the  second game session had latency issues which made the game unresponsive at times and made  communication difficult among the team members. Here are a few design implications standardized  hitboxes: player hitboxes had a significant impact on their player experiences players hitboxes  in the game were not standardized and they were mapped to their real world heights. With this  in mind games may benefit from standardizing the hitboxes so that no unfair advantage or  disadvantages is given to specific players due to their real-world height. Participants desired  higher levels of interaction fidelity: using haptics and props could feel more realistic within  the game world potentially increasing levels of embodiment and immersion. by providing physical  representation or props in game peripheral can potentially raise players skill caps as well.  participants stated their desire to be able to communicate with the opposing team during the  game. While previous studies with esports found that this may cause negative behavior such as  toxicity, being in the same physical space may help alleviate such negative behaviors. Thank you very  much for listening happy to take questions now
