At the same time, many current ecoaching systems have been developed without explicitly incorporating the healthcare professionals' perspective into the design process. In the current paper, we present three consecutive qualitative studies, starting from the health coach's perspective on successful coaching, progressively zooming in on the potential role and impact of technology as part of the coaching process. Our main finding is that coaches are concerned that introducing technology in the coaching process puts too much emphasis on behavioral information, lowering the attention for the client's lived experience, while understanding those experiences is key for successful coaching. We summarize our insights in a multi-channel communication model and draw implications for the design of supporting technology in health coaching.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A healthy lifestyle has many benefits. Mortality is on average lower among physically active people than among their inactive peers, and an unhealthy diet is associated with leading causes of death, including coronary heart disease and stroke [29]. However, to attain a healthy lifestyle, established routines or habits have to be broken and deeply ingrained attitudes need to be changed [58]. Health coaches may provide help in this difficult but beneficial process of behavior change.\nWe define health coaching as a client-centered process where a coach supports an individual client on achieving her goals related to health and wellbeing. The process of health coaching itself is an interpersonal process, where situational awareness, mutual coordination, and substantial knowledge about the personal characteristics and habits of the client are required. In this client-centered process, a good relationship between the client and the coach [47] and good communication skills [61] are of key importance. In related fields, the importance of a good relationship between caregiver and client is also emphasized, for example in psychotherapy [46] and in medical settings [5,56], in order to elicit patient's values [6], and to facilitate shared medical decision making [48].\nOver recent years, various e-coaching systems have been introduced that offer some unique opportunities for behavior tracking and interventions which were hitherto unavailable, either to coaches or their clients. Specifically, technologies such as smartphones, activity-trackers and health watches are equipped with a broad set of sensors, which allow for higher resolution and potentially more objective tracking, over longer periods of time, than typically afforded through users' subjective self-assessment. Moreover, advances in (big) data processing enable increasingly personalized and contextualized behavioral recommendations and motivational feedback.\nHowever, by and large, technology in health coaching to date has focused rather exclusively on the client's needs and technology affordances, typically arriving at fully automated, stand-alone e-coaching systems or apps. Neither the coach's information needs, nor the nature of the coaching process, have received sufficient consideration in the design and research of this technology. In the present paper, we aim to address this research gap by taking the coaches' perspective as point of departure in understanding the coaching process, the role of supporting technology, and the design requirements of technology aimed at supporting the coaching process.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Personal Informatics and Patient-Generated Data", "text": "Over recent years, interest in Personal Informatics and Quantified Self has been growing, where technology and user-generated data (e.g., from wearable trackers) are employed to increase a user's self-awareness and provide her with actionable insights to support the attainment of a user's self-improvement and health goals [18,[35][36][37]. This literature is predominantly client-oriented -that is, the end-user's needs and goals are the driving force in developing apps and trackers that allow for self-tracking. At the same time, self-tracking is increasingly construed as a social and collaborative activity, inevitably embedded in a social context [17,33,39,55]. This signals that health tracking frequently involves more stakeholders than the primary end-user alone, and that data may be shared. However, selftracking systems to date have relatively limited functionality in supporting such sharing [33].\nIn clinical settings, there is a growing interest in the value of personally tracked data to supplement existing clinical data, by providing more contextualized and continuous health information. Research on such patient-generated data (PGD) has a broader focus than the empowerment and needs of the patient; it also studies the clinicians' needs regarding PGD, and the extent to which PGD fits and impacts current healthcare practices and workflows [10,22,27,32,42,54,57,59,60,62].

[1,45,51]. Health coaching is generally conceptualized as a client -or patient -centered process, supporting the health needs and goals of the client. In line with this, the systems in use to date, be they apps (e.g., Runkeeper, MyFitnessPal) or wearable sensing devices (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit), focus primarily on the end-user wearing the device, not on the social or professional context of use.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The Coach's Perspective in e-Coaching Systems", "text": "Designing systems that support the process of healthy behavior change, however, does not imply that technology assisting in this process should focus exclusively on the client. First, as e-coaching technology is, to an extent, emulating the role of a coach, a deep understanding of what constitutes a successful coaching process should be incorporated into the design of e-coaching systems. Second, as both personal informatics and e-coaching systems are frequently part of a larger ecosystem of behavior change agents which explicitly includes human professionals (e.g., health coaches, medical doctors), the design of such systems should also incorporate the perspective of these stakeholders, the dynamics of the interpersonal coaching relationship, and the requirements of a successful coaching process. Although the primary goal of the coach is to support the client, she has her own unique perceptions, information needs and attitudes towards technology that are fundamental to inform the design of e-coaching systems that will be of value to professionals as well as their clients, and not disruptive of the client-coach relationship nor the coaching process.

Medical treatment as part of the health coaching process are beyond the scope of this paper, since the process of diagnosing and treating diseases are often associated with more strict guidelines and standard procedures, and thus bring different dynamics into the process. We will take the health coach's perspective on the coaching process as a point of departure and will progressively zoom in on the potential role and impact of technology as part of that process. We will address the following research questions: ( To answer these research questions, we conducted three consecutive qualitative studies. In Study 1, through semistructured interviews, we explored coaches' reflections on the process of health coaching, addressing what defines successful coaching, as well as common barriers and success factors that coaches encounter in their day-to-day practice. In Study 2, using a focus group, we explicitly considered the potential role of technology in health coaching. We explored the extent to which potential technology interventions resonate with current coaching practices and focused on the coaches' perceptions and attitudes towards the use of technology. In Study 3, we observed coaches interacting with clients as well as healthdata in a hands-on workshop, allowing for a deeper reflection on the potential role of technology, based on this experience.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we will discuss each of these studies in detail, and will reflect on the potential role and impact of technology in the coaching process. These insights will be used to formulate design considerations for future technology solutions supporting the coaching process.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "STUDY 1: EXPLORATION OF THE COACHING PROCESS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Nine Dutch health coaches (seven women and two men, average age of 37 years, ranging from 25 to 56 years) volunteered to participate in the interviews. On average, they had 10 years working experience, ranging from 2 to 28 years. The coaches were all working on individual basis with healthy clients having health-and wellbeing-related goals, by focusing on diet, physical activity, or both. We interviewed three dietitians, four personal trainers, one coach providing online coaching and one teacher/researcher in coaching, who is also a sports coach.\nThe interviews, held in spring 2016, were semi-structured, and conducted by one researcher in a face-to-face setting. The duration varied between 30 and 60 minutes. The interview questions were: As we aimed for a broad understanding of health coaching, we asked about many aspects of coaching (questions 1-5).\nWith the sixth question, we hinted at opportunities for technology, without being overly explicit.\nSaturation was used as a stopping criterion: data collection ended when for three consecutive interviews no major new insights emerged. Two researchers agreed that the data was saturated after nine interviews. All recordings were transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis was performed following established guidelines [8]. The final coding of the data was executed by two researchers. The inter-rater reliability (IRR), expressed in percentage of agreement per interview per theme, was on average 98.8%, with a minimum of 88.0%. All disagreements were resolved by discussion.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Four major themes emerged from the thematic analysis, which are summarized in Table 1 along with their subthemes. Below, all themes and subthemes are discussed. Coaches also note that often a more profound issue is underlying the explicit goals the client initially presents. For example, bad self-esteem might be underlying a weight loss goal. As Coach #7 explains: \"The first impression is that someone wants to lose weight, but in my experience, it's never about that. It's really about somebody fighting something within themselves [\u2026] So it is my role as a coach to understand which emotions are there, and to be sensitive.\"\nFurthermore, the coaches indicate that client's awareness of their personal health and behavior is considered as a valuable benefit of coaching. Coach #5: \"In my opinion, if a client didn't achieve the weight loss, it can still be successful, because something changed in their awareness.\" Awareness about the impact of a certain diet or behavior on health is important to help clients make deliberate choices. Coach #3 strongly argues that coaching can still be successful when clients are choosing the unhealthy option sometimes, if they are aware of the impact and if their choice is deliberate.\nWhen talking about monitoring progress, some coaches are concerned about clients being obsessed with the numbers. For example, Coach #1 states that long term perseverance is more likely when clients enjoy what they do, instead of focusing on, for example, speed or burned calories. On the other hand, quantitative measures can also positively influence the experience. Coach #7 explains: \"I have people who have such a bad self-esteem, or lost touch with reality of their bodies, that unless I can show them on paper, 'look, you're making progress!' they won't believe me.\" Coaches indicate that the effect of monitoring, either automatically or by keeping manual diaries, on their behavior and motivation, varies from client to client. For example, Coach #2 explains: \"Some people, when they see 8,000 steps on their activity tracker and know they have to reach 10,000, they will go for an extra walk to achieve their goal.\"", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Theme III: The Value of a Personal (Human) Approach.", "text": "All coaches emphasize the value of the relationship between client and coach in order to be successful. For example, Coach #3 says: \"It is about the trust relationship between client and coach, which implies certain skills a coach should have: standing by someone, being open, not judgmental, providing safety, guiding someone, listening, being empathic.\" Many coaches report that the first consultation is aimed purely at building a relationship with the client and that this is a prerequisite to start working towards goals.\nThe role of social support of friends and family is also mentioned as a success factor. Coach #1 and #8 stress the value of a supporting spouse, and Coach #5 explains how effective it is when clients share their health goals with their colleagues and friends, to help them stay motivated.\nThroughout all interviews, a personally tailored approach emerges as being important. All coaches state that what they do depends on the client. For example, Coach #2 explains: \"I'm always looking for the things that a client needs. What motivates, helps, triggers him, or maybe just reassures him at this moment?\" Notably, almost all coaches report they tailor intuitively and that the process of tailoring is hard to explain explicitly. However, further probing does reveal certain personal and situational characteristics they use in their tailoring. Personal characteristics include personal goals or problems, the client's need for empathy (e.g., a strict approach versus 'hand holding'), how motivated clients are, their base level (\"With some of my clients, I'm already happy if they'd eat one piece of fruit a day\" (Coach #9)), potential physical injuries or limitations, gender, age, profession and their place of residence (rural or urban). Situational characteristics are even more commonly mentioned by the coaches as tailoring aspects and are discussed separately in the next section (Theme III).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Theme III: Adapt the Advice to Situational", "text": "Characteristics. All coaches stress the importance of adapting the advice to situational characteristics of the client. They try to make the advice very specific and fit it into the daily life of the client. Practical constraints like working night shifts, truck drivers who are on the road, or different cultural backgrounds are extensively discussed in consultation meetings to find feasible solutions. Even backup plans are made, as Coach #5 illustrates: \"If a client plans to go for a run, but does not want to run in the rain, I suggest installing a weather-app and we discuss a back-up plan.\"\nIt may not always be easy to gain access to reliable information about a client's daily life and behavior. The coaches mention common problem with clients withholding information -simply because they don't know it is relevant, or to avoid shame. Some coaches indicate that the client's context may often reveal highly relevant information about the client. For example, Coach #3 reports: \"consultations where a partner or parent joins gives me much more information. [\u2026] Also, home visits are a very important source of information, seeing the kitchen and the fridge tells me a lot.\" Coach #9 asks the clients to make a food journal: \"It says it all. Some people forget it, then you know they're not motivated, [\u2026]. Some write very sloppy, others very tidy, including the times, others bring food to the consultation or make pictures. It's not only the information itself, but also the way it is presented, which is very informative.\" Thus, examining the context of the client offers a rich source of information and helps to tailor the coaching process to the client's needs.\nNot only external, practical barriers but also internal, personal barriers play a role in coaching. For example, the coaches report they must be sensitive to their client's stress levels in order to gauge their readiness to change behavior. Coach #2 explains: \"When there are big stressors like divorce or change of jobs, it is very hard to change behavior\". Some coaches talk about 'the right moment' to make the change. Knowing barriers that impede adherence to the coaching plan helps to better understand and assist the client.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Theme IV:", "text": "Motivation Is Important. All coaches report that for long-term behavior change, motivation is very important. First, reasonable expectations should be elicited; it makes a difference if clients realize that change is hard. Coach #8 and #9 report that they have had clients expecting them to be a magician and that just visiting them will initiate a change, not realizing that they need to change themselves. Second, being intrinsically motivated is indicated as key for success by all coaches. Some coaches indicate that clients who visit them because their doctor referred them (e.g., because of diabetes) are the most difficult to coach, because they do not come on their own initiative.\nAlthough overall success is more than reaching explicit goals (see Theme I), all coaches emphasize that setting specific, measurable short-term goals is essential in providing success experiences, and thus motivation. Coach #7 compares the short-term goal \"losing some body fat\" with \"losing 0.5% body fat\". She described the power of making the goal very specific: \"[\u2026] Next week, 0.5% done, high five, everybody happy, check off that goal. You see what I mean? [\u2026] To the mental side, it makes a world of difference.\" Not only measurable, also achievable goals are important, as they increase self-efficacy. It is common practice for coaches to make gradual, step-by-step changes.\nIn order to keep clients motivated, it is very important to focus on (small) successes, and divert the attention away from inevitable stagnations or lapses in adherence. Coach #2 explains that this is especially important when dealing with clients who have low self-esteem, for example those who are binge-eating. Coach #6 often creates a personalized progress report for clients to make the success over the longer term visible.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion: Coaches' Reflections on Successful Coaching", "text": "The interviews demonstrate coaches' reflections on successful health coaching and the factors that may impact that process. Summarizing, health coaching is an interpersonal process that goes beyond measurable goals and activities. Goals and corresponding successes are often related to the client's experience rather than measurable behavior, and a good relation between client and coach is a prerequisite for successful coaching. The interviews also illustrate the importance of fitting the advice to situational characteristics: The more specific and tailored the advice, the more likely clients are to adhere to it. Tailoring shows to be an important aspect of successful coaching, yet coaches find it hard to formalize this process. Intrinsic motivation of the client is considered as a key success factor, and specific and achievable short-term goals help clients to stay motivated and increase self-efficacy.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "STUDY 2: POTENTIAL ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN HEALTH COACHING", "text": "Purposely, we did not mention the role of technology explicitly in the interviews in Study 1.

The group consisted of a dietitian, two personal trainers and an online coach. The session, held in autumn 2016, lasted 2 hours and was facilitated by the same researcher who conducted the interviews. The coaches received a small financial compensation for their participation.\nThe focus group started with a short 'warming up': a car navigation system was discussed as a metaphor for the potential role of technology. This was framed by the levels of automation per sub task as proposed by Parasuraman, Sheridan and Wickens [50]: information acquisition and analysis (e.g., road network, traffic congestion information), decision making (e.g., the driver is provided with route information while driving) and action (e.g., self-driving car, cruise control). The coaches were asked to apply the idea of such levels of automation on subtasks in health coaching. First, the coaches individually wrote down their thoughts for 10 minutes, after which a group discussion started. The group discussion was driven by the following questions, which were visible on a screen during the session. The facilitator refocused the attention to one these questions whenever the discussion was going off topic. The session was video-recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nSegments were selected when relevant to one of the themes 'potential role of technology' and 'perception of, or attitude towards technology'.

The facilitator did not need to intervene often; all four coaches were open and willing to share their opinions and experiences. The facilitator only interrupted to give turn to other coaches, or to refocus the attention to one of the main questions. In the sections below the emerging themes are explained. According to the coaches, interpreting and reflecting on the story of a client is a very important element of successful coaching, and not something that technology can, or should, do. For example, they report that it is very effective to connect a client's goals to her values (e.g., being fit so you can play with your children), and as Coach #C explains: \"A computer couldn't interpret this, and reflect, like: 'I understand you'\". Even in the case technology would be able to do this, the coaches think it will be more effective for a human coach to take this role. All coaches agreed that a fully automated coaching solution would not sufficiently motivate clients. Coach #B reports: \"That personal touch is crucial, because only controlled by a computer\u2026 I myself would also be like: whatever. But if someone is looking, it's different.\" Furthermore, the coaches express concern about losing skills by too much interference of technology in the process, e.g., being sensitive to cues of the client, and being alert and ready. Coach #C questions: \"What makes us humans unique? And what makes us to each other? And if we outsource that to technology\u2026 we lose a lot of human strength. That idea scares me.\"", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "More and", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Analysis of the Client's Data.", "text": "The coaches indicate that a structured use of a client's data can help in the coaching process. Coach #C illustrates this with an example of a client who was often feeling faint during exercises. By structurally keeping a record she could pinpoint this to a certain type of exercise and was able to tailor the training sessions such that the problem was resolved. Also, the coaches see a benefit of using data for calculating realistic goals based on the client's history.\nThe coaches do not see much added value of relating the data of single clients to those of others, such as using data of a large group of clients to explore preferences and new opportunities for clients. When this topic emerged, Coach reported: \"Ok, maybe a database would be a good addition, but in the end of the day\u2026 You know, everyone is unique.\" She explains that, although a coach is expert on health, the client is expert on herself. With that perspective, coaches consider it their task to tune the coaching program to the client's needs and possibilities and facilitate her in her own process. They do not feel technology could be sensitive enough to fulfill this serving and humble role, nor that additional information of other clients would improve this process. Another objection of the coaches against the idea of using data of other clients, is that this might lead to recommendations reinforcing current (potential unhealthy) behavior, instead of pushing a client slightly out of her comfort zone. They explain the fine line between engaging the client with activities that she enjoys, at the same time challenging her a little bit. Finding and keeping the right balance is a subtle and socially interactive process, and they do not trust the capabilities of technology in this regard.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations of Data and Negative Psychological Effects.", "text": "The coaches report that the use of (too much) technology may increase the risk that clients become obsessed by the data instead of listening to their bodies and enjoying the activity. The coaches state that tracking data encourages competition, whereas they feel that persistence of healthy behavior is related to joy of the activity. They consider themselves to have important role in both reminding the client to listen to her body, and in interpreting and making sense of the data. Coach #D explains: \"So I don't believe in merely data. The question is, what do you do with the data, how do you give feedback, how do you interpret the data, how do you create insights from the data that the clients don't see, (\u2026), then it becomes interesting.\" The coaches stated that the effect of the data can be very different for different people, so it is the coaches' task to carefully use the data and show it at the right moment and in the right way. Furthermore, they are skeptical about the existence of a ground truth on what constitutes healthy behavior, so having the data does not necessarily imply a straightforward interpretation.\nImportantly, the coaches note an additional responsibility when confronted with (more) data.

For one, coaches expect that an emphasis on data may foster obsessive behavior. Also, they think may not be sufficiently advanced to appropriately tailor its interventions to the individual client. Thus, they are skeptical about automatically generated recommendations or feedback, and feel that automated interventions that lack the involvement of a human coach will not be very effective.

They report: \"She just very structured.

This is obviously noted by the coaches consulting her data, but they draw the wrong conclusion: she might not work as hard as she reports. On the other hand, the coaches with data have access to much more detail on client #1's diet. Therefore, they advise her to take the carbohydrate-rich meal before her training session instead of after, to increase the effectiveness of the training. The timing of this meal remains hidden for the coaches in dialog.\nAdditionally, client #2 has limited knowledge on training schemes; she declared to the coaches: \"I started running immediately 4 or 5 kilometers.

In developing such tools, the coach's role and perspective are rarely fully understood or well-represented. We believe that in order to develop successful e-coaching applications, we need to have a deeper appreciation of what constitutes a successful coaching process, which includes both the client and coach perspectives. In the current paper we aim to extend our understanding of the coach's perspective on e-coaching technology, and the potential value that technology and (tracked) data may have in a successful coaching process and a productive coaching relationship.\nBased on the interviews with health coaches in our first study, we conclude health coaching is about understanding the client -both in terms of behavior and experience -and effectively anticipating on that. Inspired by the telecommunication model [63], we depict this process as two communication channels between client and coach, one focused behavioral data and one on the client's lived experience, i.e., sharing stories, and daily experiences (see Figure 1a). Our second and third study reveal that coaches see that technology has the potential to improve the understanding of the behavioral aspects of the client, i.e., by tracking and sharing data. At the same time, coaches emphasize the importance of having information about the client's experience, and they believe that this is too subtle and ambiguous for technology to 'understand'. a result, coaches that incorporating technology into their coaching practice results in overemphasizing 'objective' and numerical information on measurable behavior, thereby discounting subjective experience and personal context, which would be detrimental to the coaching process (see Figure 1b). We will discuss these results in more detail below, and propose an intermediate communication channel to bridge behavior and experience (see Figure 1c).", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "Technology Provides More Information on Behavior", "text": "In health coaching, information on health-related behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity) is key for successful coaching. The coaches clearly recognize the value of technology giving them access to better and more reliable information about the training sessions and the client's daily behavior. This resonates with insights from the sports psychology domain where monitoring technology for athletes provides metrics that are helpful to plan and optimize training programs [9,25]. Also the workshop (Study 3) shows that interacting with detailed behavioral data is useful to get a richer and more precise view on the client's actual behaviors and routines, which may be less prone to errors than using a client's self-reported information.\nThus, technology can provide coaches with behavioral data, which is a valuable source of information to optimize the coaching process. Yet, the coaches are skeptical about automated normative interpretation of the client's behavioral data, because ground truth metrics on what is healthy behavior are lacking. Health data are inherently ambiguous; what might be good care for one patient under certain circumstances, can be sub-optimal for another [34,53].\nThe availability of, and focus on, behavioral data might impact the client and coaching process, in particular regarding motivation. The coaches state that progress feedback or automated motivational messages in between consultation meetings can potentially be helpful, for example in making small progress become visible. There is general support in literature that feedback from technology on behavior can be an effective way to change behavior [26,49]. At the same time, coaches in our study are aware of the potential drawbacks of (real time) feedback on clients' behavior and motivation. For example, they state that when clients are more focused on the feedback than on the joy of the activity itself, it easily undermines intrinsic motivation. As illustrated in Figure 1b, behavioral data get overemphasized, leaving the subjective experience underexposed. These insights resonate with controlled experiments demonstrating detrimental effects of external rewards [14] or even just the presence of self-tracked information [19] on intrinsic motivation.\nCoaches in our study also express concern that their clients would become obsessed by the data. One's own health data is shown to inherently have emotional connotations and provoke value judgements, including shame and obsession [3,13,49]. This means that behavioral data, in addition to inadequately representing experiential qualities, may even negatively influence that experience. Thus, as the effects of feedback on motivation are mixed, it requires a deeper understanding of the client to use it arguing for systems with a 'coach-in-the-loop'.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Coaching Beyond Behavior", "text": "For successful coaching, coaches highlight the importance of understanding the client's experiences, guiding the interpretation and use of behavioral data. The importance of experiential and relational aspects of the coaching process was emphasized time and again, serving a variety of goals, including understanding a client's implicit motivations, providing adequate social support, and helping someone overcome personal barriers.\nSeveral studies in the field of Quantified Self share the idea that behavioral data are just a proxy of underlying experiences. The real value of self-tracking is often pointed out as a contextualized, subjective and social process [16,31,33,55], nicely illustrated by Rooksby, Rost, Morrison, and Chalmers who conceptualized the use of activity trackers as 'lived informatics': \"Tracking was explained in terms of people's lives, worries, hopes, interests, careers and so on\" ([55], 1171). At the same time, Lupton [38] highlights a tension, also present in our results, between quantifiable data being perceived as more reliable on the one hand, whereas on the other hand \"numbers alone tell us nothing, it is the context in which the numbers [\u2026] are created that [is] important\" (p. 6). Also for meaningful interpretation of health data among peers, context is essential for understanding [2,52].\nOur results resonate with the related field of sports psychology, where coaching is frequently characterized as a complex and ambiguous process that is hard to capture through behavioral information alone [7,30]. To infer experiential information from behavioral information, substantial contextual information as well as social intelligence is required. Despite rapid advances in artificial intelligence and context-aware computing, creating socially intelligent systems is still one of the major challenges in the field [21,24]. Because the client's behavior is relatively easy to measure, compared to the client's it is likely that behavioral information will predominate a coaching process supported by technology. This effect has also been observed in healthcare, where incorporating information technology involves the risk of focusing too much on measurable and predictable workflows, not acknowledging the flexible and fluid nature of the work [4,40], failing to emotional aspects [43], and sometimes even in work-arounds to overcome constraints introduced by technology use [11].", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Synergy between Behavioral and Experiential", "text": "Our workshop (Study 3) demonstrated that having access to behavioral data potentially facilitates the exchange of experiential information and enhances the relation between and coach. The coaches reflect on the strength of data and personal interaction: help to ask the right questions.\" It provides access to the client's context and experiences which otherwise might have been overlooked by the coaches. In this way, data can be a cue interaction, potentially triggering new topics of conversation, or directing attention to underexplored aspects of behavior. This adds to studies in medical settings, where similarly the main value of patient-generated data is to be a facilitator of collaborative reflection, communication, mutual understanding and decision making [10,27,40,42,60]. facilitate this synergy between behavior and in the coach-client interaction, it is important information from the two channels are easily connected. Ideally, experiences should emerge intuitively from representations of behaviors. Therefore, we propose an intermediate communication channel (see Figure 1c), behavioral data is represented on a meaningful level. bottom channel, behavior on a lower, data-driven level is shared, for example, 1000 steps, 7 hours of sleep, 500\nIn the intermediate channel, data is aggregated and represented in a meaningful way, shifting it to information rather than data. For example, depending on temporal, locational, and other contextual information, 1000 steps be construed as a 'lunch walk' or a 'hospital visit', or, 500 kcal a 'dinner with friends' or a 'dinner at home later than usual'. This behavioral, yet contextualized and meaningful chunks of information will more easily trigger interpretations at an experiential level in interaction with the client, e.g., 'relaxing lunch walk with a colleague' or 'stressful hospital visit with my child', providing the coach with a rich set of pointers accessing the client's daily life, context, values and needs.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "The Value of Ambiguity", "text": "An important question is, to what extent can and should technology interpret behavioral information, in to facilitate the coaching process optimally? Context-aware computing makes a helpful distinction between contextual information of behavior (the who's, where's, when's and what's) and the intention of that behavior (why the behavior has occurred) [15]. The contextual information is often not ambiguous. However, the why of the behavior, that it, the intention and meaning of the behavior to the client, remains ambiguous. A lunch walk might imply that the client was relaxed, but it can very well mean the opposite -in the case where desperately needed a break on a stressful day. Thus, behavioral information remains ambiguous in terms of experience, and is therefore problematic to interpret automatically. Ambiguity is not necessarily problematic. Gaver,Beaver and Benford [23] show that it may have value when things are left open for interpretation, as it reveals something about the identity, motivations and expectations of the interpreter. In the specific case of health data, it has been shown that the interpretation is colored by one's own beliefs [34,38]. This does not have to be amiss; the ambiguity might actually comprise the value of using those data, as long as it can be used as a conversation topic in coaching [57]. Ambiguity, or stronger, inconsistency, has also been valued in triangulation [41], a methodological concept in social sciences. Triangulation describes the process where multiple sources of evidence are used to validate a claim, for example, using multiple methods, data sources or researchers. Mathison [41] states that, we tend to strive for converging evidence, where all sources of evidence are leading to a single claim.\nHowever, often evidence is inconsistent or contradictory, and this can actually be a valuable opportunity to learn. It invites the researcher to make sense of the differences, ending up with a more holistic view of the subject of interest and more valid claims [41].", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion: Technology Supporting the Collaborative Coaching Process", "text": "In the complex and interpersonal process of health coaching, interpreting the client's behavior, i.e., talking intentions and meanings of the behavior to the client, is a highly valuable activity in itself.

It would impede collaborative reflection and the enhancement of the coachclient relationship that is critical to success. Gaps and irregularities in the data, as well as situations where behavioral and experiential information are contradicting, are valuable starting points for effective coaching.\nAt the same time, presenting behavior in a meaningful way, easily triggering the recall of experiences, is an important facilitator of the collaborative process.\nthe lines of context-aware computing, the who's, when's and what's provided by technology are used to determine why the behavior occurs [15].
