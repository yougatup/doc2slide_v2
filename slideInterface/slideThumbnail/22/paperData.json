    "text": "ABSTRACT We enable preemptive force-feedback systems to speed up human reaction time without fully compromising the user’s sense of agency. Typically these interfaces actuate by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or mechanical actuators; they preemptively move the user to perform a task, such as to improvemovement performance (e.g., EMS-assisted drumming). Unfortunately, when using preemptive forcefeedback users do not feel in control and loose their sense of agency. We address this by actuating the user’s body, using EMS, within a particular time window (160 ms after visual stimulus), which we found to speed up reaction time by 80 ms in our first study. With this preemptive timing, when the user and system move congruently, the user feels that they initiated the motion, yet their reaction time is faster than usual. As our second study demonstrated, this particular timing significantly increased agency when compared to the current practice in EMS-based devices. We conclude by illustrating, using examples from the HCI literature, how to leverage our findings to provide more agency to automated haptic interfaces."

These haptic actuated systems offer the potential to speed up the user’s physical reaction time by means of preemptive actions—the system actuates the user faster than their normal speed to perform a task that the user alsowants to perform. For instance, these systems have been used to preemptively steer the user into safety (e.g., Pedestrian Navigation [50]) or to correct the user in timing-sensitive tasks (e.g., keeping a steady rhythm [14])."

We propose that the solution to this paradox lies in the fact that our conscious awareness of intention takes a moment to arise, around 200 ms [30, 31, 40, 53]. These findings suggest a time window between a volitional action and our sense of agency for this action [40]. We exploit the fact that this time window offers flexibility to attribute agency to a preemptive action (Figure 1), i.e., one that was externally generated by a haptic device (e.g., electrical muscle stimulation) and is aligned with the user’s intention. For this hypothesis to work, one needs find out exactly when a preemptive actuation should be delivered so that it maximizes the user’s agency."

In their experiments, Frith et al. showed that participants with lesions on the motor cortex (but no lesions on the sensory organs or pathways that allow to feel touch, etc.) exhibited a decreased sense of agency [18]. This theory states that the agency is dependent on the comparison between the prediction of a movement and its outcome."

In the particular case of this experiment, we created a preemptive system that actuates the user using EMS. We designed a tapping study based a canonical psychophysics task to measure reaction time (e.g., [23, 33, 45]). We engineered the system to deliver the stimuli preemptively, i.e., before the user has time to react to it. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that any preemptive stimulation will result in a shorter reaction time, but will also decrease agency. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that there is a timing sweet spot that still offers preemption (i.e., faster than ordinary reaction time) without drastically decreasing agency."

We used the following procedure to confirm that this vibration effectively masks the EMS tingling sensation: (1) We calibrate EMS to tingle the skin but not strongly enough to actuate the arm, (2) We run the vibration motors which vibrate the participant’s arm. (3) We ask the participant to say when they feel skin tingling among the vibrations. (4) We turn on the EMS at a random point in time. (5) If participants still feel the skin tingling, we lower the EMS (never below the point of tingling) and increase the intensity of the vibrations.

As Figure 4 depicts, we found that preemption impacts agency, i.e., as we spedup the reaction time by providing more preemption to the system (i.e., EMS acted earlier), participants perceived less agency. To illustrate this we can pick two time windows in Figure 4, such as [–10, 10] ms and [290, 310] ms. In the first case, between [–10, 10] ms (i.e., actuation in syncwith visual target), the average perceived agency was barely none (avg = 1.25; std.dev = 0.43). Here, the participants’ reaction time was shortened under the typical human reaction time (avg = 47.5 ms; std.dev. = 20.2 ms). On the second case, when the EMS was offset to act between [290, 310] ms after the visual stimulus (i.e., system stimulated close to the human reaction time), the perceived agency approached the maximum (avg= 6.81; std.dev. = 0.39). However, there was no preemptive gain (reaction time avg = 281.9 ms;std.dev. = 43.6 ms).

This suggests that there is a dramatic drop in agency if we set up the EMS stimulus in a way that the preemptive gain is larger than 80 ms. To demonstrate this, let us illustrate the average agency in a particular window before and after 80 ms: we found that the average agency found in the window between 80–0 ms is 5.13 (std.dev. = 2.16) in [1- 7] scale. On the other hand, the agency dramatically drops in the window after 80 ms of preemptive gain, for instance at 160 ms we recorded a perceived agency of 1.89 (std.dev. = 1.51) in [1-7] scale.This result reinforces our H2, pointing to the time window in which it is feasible for a preemptive system to offer faster-than-normal reaction time without dramatically compromising agency. Our model suggests that such a system should actuate 160 ms after visual target, resulting in 80 ms speed up of the user’s reaction time."

We summarize these: 8 participants voiced remarks at the end of the study such as “even I did not notice that I’ve got EMS” or “I rated 6 or 5 when I felt some EMS sensation but still I believe I control my finger”, “When I rated 7, I think there was not EMS and I solely touched the screen by my own”. In particular, P2 noted that, with an early-stimulation of -200 ms, “it’s too fast, it moves before I do”. This further emphasizes that, at this timing, participants are able to distinguish the order of these two events, i.e., they realized the EMSmoved them before theywanted tomove—alignedwith Wegner’s agency principles. Conversely, when stimulated in a timing around 160 ms after the target appeared, the same P2 stated “I know I felt some tingling but I thought it was some weak feedback, but, now [in hindsight] I actually believe I moved my finger too”; we observed analogous comments from other participants—this depicted a timing alignment that enabled participant’s “thought” to first arise (preserved the priority principle) and to be consistent with the outcome, which was the on-screen feedback after tapping the screen (consistency principle). P5 even stated “I know this [the EMS] moved my finger, at some point, but I feel this [EMS] and my movement to get integrated, rather than just moved by it”. Interestingly, two participants did not realize that, during the trials, the stimulus timing was being manipulated, as P6 puts it: “I did not notice that timing was controlled. I just thought that only difference is the strength of this [EMS]”. P6 added “When I answered 7, I did not notice that I was moved by the EMS [although it was the EMS that responded faster than P6, in many of these trials]. When answered 6, I partially felt the sensation but I still believed that I was the one who moved [although in many of these trials, the EMS moved faster than the participant]”."

Therefore, we utilized a non-parametric test.

We opted for a direct measure instead of using other study paradigms that indirectly measure agency, such as Intentional Binding (IB) [9, 10]. The IB paradigm uses a delay between the user’s action and the feedback (usually a auditory feedback). If this delay is perceived shorter by user than it actually is, the user feels more agency regarding this pair of action and outcome. However, our preemptive action includes a EMSinduced tap (involuntary) that might be followed by a later (voluntary) finger tap as users still press the screen after the EMS has tapped it. Even if IB paradigm does find a shift in the perceived delay between action and outcome, there is an ambiguity in whether the binding was with the involuntary movement (EMS) or in the later voluntary movement (the extra screen push). This could present a severe confound to the study as the side effects are unknown at this point. Therefore we opted for a direct measure; however, we believe it might be interesting to explore whether IB can still be used during EMS preemption in the future. Lastly, it is worth noting that previous research has shown that both indirect and direct measures are valid ways to assess agency [13, 43]."

The EMG records the extensor’s electrical activity and thus measures the onset of movement that releases the pen. The system uses a fixed threshold to detect this peak in the extensor’s EMG activity and immediately issues the command to stimulate the flexormuscle of the user trying to grab the pen. This results in an EMS preemptive actuation that is delayed only by 60 ms from the moment of peak detection of the EMG. This latency includes 10 ms of communication delay and 50 ms until the EMS-induced grasp is completed (data from [46])."

Again, this system immediately triggers the EMSwhen the user grabs the spray can, even if the user actually wants “to shake it”. Authors found in their studies that these automated actions shifted agency from the user to the object (e.g., “it [the spray can] wants to shake” [38]. Now, if we re-implement such a system, we could tune its temporal behavior to trigger the muscle stimulation later in the preemption-agency curve.

The most intriguing and exciting of our findings is not that our approach provides more agency than the current practice, but that so many participants felt in control even when the action was triggered by EMS. These participants voiced remarks at the end of the study such as “I did not notice that I’ve got EMS”, “I felt some EMS sensation but still I believe I control my finger”, and so forth. To this end, the cognitive neuroscience literature provides a plausible explanation: as demonstrated by Libet et al., the “desire to act” can arise, in consciousness, after the motor commands have been issued, i.e., after starting to move [31]. Thus, by designing our preemptive timing to provide a stimulus 80 ms before the participants’ average reaction time, we have purposely inserted the involuntary muscle motion in Libet’s range, i.e., around 200-300 ms before the conscious act manifests itself. Thus, the origin of the motion (EMS) gets obfuscated in this timeline."

Regarding the consistency principle, Wen et al. challenge it with their findings [61], they found that performance (i.e., quality of the outcome) was more important to participants’ sense of agency than the action-feedback association. With regards to the priority principle, David et al. found that, in an AR experiment where both the outcome (system’s auditory response to a movement) and the participant’s own movement were temporally manipulated, “participants were more sensitive to delays of outcome than to delays of movement execution”. This speaks in favor of our approach, which provides an active manipulation of the movement execution (by preempting it), but attempts to preserve an optimal time in outcome presentation (by not preempting it too much). Also, it is worth noting that fact that our preemptive action improved agency but never provided a sense of complete agency for all participants in all trials; this suggests that our results are in line with Haggard et al.’s four stages of agency [21], which postulates a stage inwhich our brain can veto a motor response [20]."

However, research suggests that these are distinct neural mechanisms [27, 58, 64]. Much like agency, the ownership can be modulated using virtual representations of one’s own body (e.g., avatars in VR [4] or proxy objects such as a rubber hand [7, 32, 62]). This manipulation of the sense of ownership has been shown in some cases to also affect the sense of agency [3, 4]."

In fact, our choice of using electrical muscle stimulation as a haptic actuator, granted that users always felt (via their proprioception) that it was their own body moving—we did not received commentary typical of participants experiencing a loss in sense of ownership. Thus, the choice of EMS as our haptic actuator puts aside, in broad terms, the concern of compromising the sense of ownership. However, if researchers would apply our ideas to other haptic actuators that might be decoupled from the user’s own body (e.g., teleoperating a robotic arm [49]), the interaction effects between preemption and sense of ownership might be worth investigating."
