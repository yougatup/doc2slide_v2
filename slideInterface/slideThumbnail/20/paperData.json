    "text": "ABSTRACT Phone numbers are intimately connected to our digital lives. People are increasingly required to disclose their phone number in digital spaces, both commercial and personal. While convenient for companies, the pervasive use of phone numbers as user identifers also poses privacy, security, and access risks for individuals. In order to understand these risks, we present fndings from a qualitative online elicitation study with 195 participants about their negative experiences with phone numbers, the consequences they faced, and how those consequences impacted their behavior. Our participants frequently reported experiencing phone number recycling, unwanted exposure, and temporary loss of access to a phone number. Resulting consequences they faced included harassment, account access problems, and privacy invasions. Based on our fndings, we discuss service providers’ faulty assumptions in the use of phone numbers as user identifers, problems arising from phone number recycling, and provide design and public policy recommendations for mitigating these issues with phone numbers."

As a consumer technology writer, Chen had asked a security researcher to expose as much information about him as possible using only his phone number. Right away, the researcher obtained his home address, the full names of his immediate family members, phone numbers he had previously owned, his property tax records, and his (lack of) criminal history. Although the researcher did not use this information for any nefarious purposes, he noted that if he had wanted to, he had a good chance of getting into Chen’s personal accounts, scamming his family out of money, or even taking over his phone number."

While a phone number used to serve as an intentionally public piece of information listed in community phone books for the convenience of one’s friends and neighbors, these numbers now serve a far broader purpose. A phone number can reveal a signifcant amount about a person. In the hands of a company that relies on advertising, a user can have their online identity tracked, sold, and potentially exposed through data breaches or bad privacy practices [72]. In the hands of an individual, a phone number could reveal a person’s physical location, their private online accounts, and provide direct, intimate access to them [17]."

Companies rely on phone numbers as convenient identifers for their users, assuming that a phone number uniquely identifes a single person, persistently over time, and that users are comfortable and able to share their phone number with the company and with other users through an app or service. As we show, these assumptions lead to a host of potential privacy, security, and access problems for individuals. Exacerbating these issue and creating further problems are the ways that phone numbers change hands through number recycling, creating inconvenience for new owners of a number and exposing personal information about the previous owner."

Due to hijacking risks with SMS-based MFA [65] and the availability of more efective second factors, the use of SMS as a second factor has been discouraged by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in favor of hardware and software token generators [35]."

Online services and applications may use a phone number to send SMS alerts and notifcations to users. Such alerts might be sent by online services or by businesses a person interacts with in the physical world (e.g., a doctor’s ofce, apartment complexes, stores). For example, a pharmacy might ofer to send customers an SMS when their prescription is ready [18], or airlines might alert a customer when their fight is delayed [4]. While such communication is often opt-in, SMS notifcations can create a potentially sensitive leak of information. As with email [60], if these alerts were to go to the wrong person, for example after a number has been recycled, they could reveal a significant amount of personal information about the intended recipient and the intended recipient may miss important information. Phone Number as an Identifer. Phone numbers are increasingly used as a way to identify and authenticate users in place of a username or email address. For example, loyalty programs frequently use phone number or email address to track purchases and rewards [46]. For some services, such as Twitter, users can opt to use a phone number rather than an email address to create an account [69]. In these cases, the user will typically need to verify that they own the phone number by receiving a phone call or SMS with a one-time code that they enter into the application or website. As noted above, the phone number may also be used in place of a password as the sole mechanism for proving ownership of an account."

On platforms like Facebook, companies can upload lists of phone numbers in order to directly target those individuals with ads [22]. The common use of phone numbers across platforms means that companies may have a better chance of connecting and aggregating data from the same individual across multiple platforms and online spaces, compared to usernames which may or may not be consistently used. Much of this phone number use is done outside of the view of the user and therefore, such violations to privacy will be difcult for people to recognize. This use of phone numbers arguably ofers little or no beneft to the afected users, but is proftable for companies. Phone Numbers to Build Peer Networks. Phone numbers may also be used as a way to construct peer networks. For example, many mobile messengers like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal use phone numbers in place of usernames [66, 68, 73], which allows users to fnd each other on the platform if they know each others’ phone numbers. This takes advantage of many people already having phone numbers of their friends, family, and colleagues saved in their phone’s contacts, allowing a new app to construct a possible network of acquaintances by requesting access to the phone’s contacts. For example, Facebook’s People You May Know feature uses a user’s phone number and uploaded contacts to suggest which other Facebook users to connect with [26]. This can be benefcial both for users, who can easily fnd other people on platforms, and for companies, who can proft from learning social networks.

MFA can provide an extra layer of security to an account by preventing an attacker from logging into an account with a stolen or guessed password alone. While these one-time codes can be generated by a hardware token or sent via an app or email address, SMS remains a common medium for sending MFA codes to users, and is sometimes the only way for users to enable MFA."

If a user has forgotten their password or lost access to an email address, access to the phone number that is associated with the account might be used as an indication that they are the rightful user of that account. Phone Numbers as a Test of Uniqueness. A phone number is also sometimes used to prevent the same user from creating multiple accounts, or to limit the number of accounts per person. This mechanism relies on the assumption that having numerous phone numbers will be challenging for most users, as they may be expensive. Furthermore, in contrast to email addresses, which could be anonymous and which a user could have an unlimited number of, phone numbers are often connected to a person’s legal identity. This restriction may also function as an accountability mechanism. If someone is banned from a platform, the need to obtain a diferent phone number might hamper their ability to rejoin the community under a diferent alias. For example, Facebook does not allow users to have multiple or fake identities on the platform, because they “believe that people are more accountable for their statements and actions when they use their authentic identities” [23]. Although Facebook enforces this policy using more information than phone numbers alone, they also prevent multiple accounts from using the same phone number [25]."

Google, like Facebook, also seems to limit the number of accounts per phone number [16, 42]. This restriction can beneft both users and the company, but when people are limited to only one account it may create barriers for people who have a legitimate need for multiple separate accounts, for example for professional and personal use or to represent diferent aspects of their identity."

Codebooks were initially generated for each question, but we quickly observed heavy overlap across topics and combined them into one codebook (e.g., the question about phone number recycling contained descriptions of many of the other experiences we asked about). After an initial codeset was generated from these readings, two researchers discussed and merged overlapping codes, grouped similar codes into higher-level themes (e.g., “made up phone number” and “used old number” merged to “gave fake phone number”). We then tested the utility of the codebook on a subset of the data, adding new codes and merging further overlapping codes, with discussion, until no further changes were necessary, which required two rounds.

I recognize that it could be recycled to other people, but I don’t care. Everybody wants your phone number for marketing purposes and people who claim they don’t give your number to anyone could be telling the truth since they SELL your number to other people....” Participants are aware of the implications of sharing their phone numbers and look for ways to mitigate these issues through obfuscation, or adding fake information into a system meant to track them, thus disrupting the efcacy of the system [12].

Here, we highlight how the use of phone numbers as identifers by companies in particular creates challenges for individuals. Our fndings show that the implicit assumptions by companies that phone numbers are persistent and unique, that a phone number is consistently available for authentication and account use, and that people are comfortable sharing their phone number with a company and possibly with other users, are fawed. Phone numbers might not be unique or persistent. While many services operate assuming that a phone number will persistently belong to one user, people can and do change phone numbers; indeed, almost half of our participants had gotten a new number in the last 5 years. When people forget or are unable to update their phone number, this may result in missed notifcations, login problems, account lockouts, or private information being sent to the wrong person."

Although only one of our participants shares a phone number with a spouse, this is likely a larger issue internationally in places where sharing devices is more common [3]. Shared devices may cause additional problems when multiple accounts cannot be associated with the same number, or if a login can be processed through a verifcation code sent via SMS rather than a username and password, allowing a diferent user of the device to log in against the wishes of the account holder. Phone numbers are not always available. Even when people are willing or required to provide their phone number, the mobile network may not be consistently available. As shown by our participants, people may be unable to pay their phone bill, may travel or move internationally, or otherwise lose access to a phone number temporarily or permanently. 14 of our participants reported issues with account access due to international travel or living, causing problems from inconvenience to complete and permanent inaccess. Potentially worse, phone number recycling means that recovery codes might be delivered to the wrong person, providing them with information that could be used to hijack an account. In either case, the use of a phone number as a way to authenticate or recover an account can create costly barriers, which may be especially frustrating in cases where the phone number itself is not necessary to provide the service. Sharing can give unwanted intimate access. In the previous cases, problems arise when a number cannot reliably identify or authenticate someone over time. In other cases, a phone number being a persistent personal identifer — and shared inappropriately — is the issue. Phone numbers directly provide the ability to contact an individual, regardless of the context or reason the phone number was provided. As is well documented, Facebook’s People You May Know (PYMK) feature has been shown to cause a number of similar issues to the ones we identify here. PYMK opportunistically suggests friends based on information Facebook collects about users, including phone numbers [26]. This can be a problem for someone who uses a phone number in multiple contexts. For example, sex workers who work under an alias to protect their identity may see clients being suggested as friends on Facebook, despite taking"

Many mobile messengers, such as WhatsApp and Signal, display a user’s phone number to everyone that person chats with. A protest group using WhatsApp to communicate not only exposes all members of the group to one another, but also to anyone who confscates a member’s device or infltrates the group. This is exactly what happened in March 2020, when the Lebanese Government reportedly used WhatsApp groups to infltrate the social networks of protesters and track them based on phone numbers [5, 43]. Once a phone number is in the hands of an adversarial government agency, it can be used to physically fnd and track the owner with a cell-site simulator, as has been done by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fnd and deport immigrants [67]."

As described by historian Sarah Igo, when introduced in the 1930s, SSNs were controversial; meant to facilitate the collection, and later disbursement, of fnancial benefts for workers, some skeptics feared they were the beginning of a national identity system. As the system gained traction and some critical number of Americans opted in, those who were left without this number began to be locked out of job opportunities. Those who had been assigned a number might even show it of publicly, for example by having it engraved on jewelry or even tattooed onto their bodies [40]."

      "text": "Phone numbers are intimately connected to our online and ofine lives. Our online elicitation study with 195 phone users yielded qualitative insights into the range of negative experiences connected to the way phone numbers are used. We fnd that people struggle with phone number recycling, loss of access to their number, and deal with privacy concerns. We also fnd that people experience signifcant harms following these issues, including harassment, account access issues, and eroded trust in companies, which lead people to adopt inconvenient and largely inefective coping strategies. Based on our fndings we discuss how faulty assumptions made by companies in their use of phone numbers as user identifers lead to infexible and sometimes harmful design decisions, and how companies and regulators should step in to provide better protections against privacy harms from phone number use online."

      "text": "Ultimately, while individuals might be able to take small steps to protect themselves, the ability to make the best decisions for themselves is severely limited by the decisions companies are making about how to collect and use phone numbers. People use phones and their phone numbers in so many diferent ways — not every person will have a phone number that is uniquely theirs across space and time, that corresponds to all parts of their online identity. It is the joint responsibility of companies, regulators, and researchers to fnd the way forward for online account management that is safe and feasible for all people."
