    "text": "ABSTRACT Compared to grounded force feedback, providing tactile feedback via a wearable device can free the user and broaden the potential applications of simulated physical interactions. However, neither the limitations nor the full potential of tactile-only feedback have been precisely examined. Here we investigate how the dimensionality of cutaneous fngertip feedback afects user movements and virtual object recognition. We combine a recently invented 6-DOF fngertip device with motion tracking, a head-mounted display, and novel contact-rendering algorithms to enable a user to tactilely explore immersive virtual environments. We evaluate rudimentary 1-DOF, moderate 3-DOF, and complex 6-DOF tactile feedback during shape discrimination and mass discrimination, also comparing to interactions with real objects. Results from 20 naive study participants show that higher-dimensional tactile feedback may indeed allow completion of a wider range of virtual tasks, but that feedback"

Although compelling haptic rendering can be achieved by applying feedback at other parts of the user’s hand or body, the goal of this paper is to examine the role of tactile dimensionality at the fngertip, as the fngertip plays an essential role in manipulation tasks and is commonly the focus of haptic device research. As shown in Fig. 1, we are purposefully focusing on rich tactile cues and omitting the grounded forces and torques that physically oppose fnger movements during real contact in order to achieve a large workspace while limiting system cost and user encumbrance; this popular strategy is sometimes called sensory subtraction [35]. Importantly, even our complex 6-DOF consideration of fnger-surface interactions completely disregards the local shape and material properties of the object being contacted, which would require infnite dimensions for proper portrayal. Instead, we aim to represent any physical contact with the surface’s local tangent plane as a frst-order approximation, in much the same way that computer graphics models often represent surfaces as polygon meshes."

[17] classifed grips that humans use to grasp common objects, fnding that diferent objects consistently elicited contact with diferent parts of the index fnger, including the volar, radial, and distal aspects. Atzori and Müller [1] presented the Ninapro database, which included over 20 grasping movements that again elicited normal force and shear force at multiple locations on the index fnger. Feix et al. [8] compiled existing human grasp taxonomies into a single GRASP taxonomy, which divided grasps into power, intermediate, and precision categories. Power grasps tended to require the volar aspect of the index fnger, intermediate grasps tended to require the radial aspect of the index fnger, and precision grasps often required the distal-most tip of the index fnger. Figure 2 illustrates a small sample of common interactions discussed in these references, also depicting the corresponding forces that act at diferent locations on the index fnger."

Three-DOF fngertip devices have demonstrated the ability to move a contact element along a spherical surface around the fngertip and translate in the direction normal to the sphere [10, 38], tilt a contact surface in place with 2 DOF and then extend into the volar side of the fngertip [2, 32], or provide 3-DOF feedback that couples orientation and position in a more complex manner [25, 34]. At least one design has ofered 3-DOF translation of a contact element with a fxed orientation to render more precise shear cues [37], and another has presented 3-DOF translation via asymmetric vibrations from three orthogonal actuators [19]."

As such, this device has the potential to render the entire 6-DOF set of possible interactions between a stationary index fnger and a fat surface: one DOF for how hard the fnger presses into the surface (making contact and normal force), two DOFs for rotating the fnger such that a diferent location on the fngertip contacts the surface, two DOFs for sliding the fnger along the surface (translational shear), and one DOF for twisting the fnger on the surface (rotational shear)."

As mentioned in Sec. 1, the Fuppeteer is able to render the tangent plane of a surface; it is not designed to display edges or highly curved surfaces. We previously noted that end-efector pose error tends to accumulate over time, and we presented a quick calibration routine through which accumulated error could be eliminated. Due to the compliance of the parallel continuum manipulator design, some end-efector motions result in sustained oscillations. However, we previously demonstrated that trajectory constraints minimized these vibrations, resulting in no noticeable oscillatory forces once the platform contacts the user’s fngertip; we implement the same trajectory constraints in this paper. Although the Fuppeteer is position controlled, the device’s compliance also means that forces acting on the end-efector cause some amount of deformation, resulting in a complex relationship between confguration and stifness.

The pulley system reduces the acceleration of the counterweight itself, limiting the efect of the counterweight’s inertia on the force applied to the device, and preventing slack in the counterweight line unless the device is accelerated upward at over about 39 m/s2 (four times gravitational acceleration)."

With the 3-DOF and 6-DOF controllers, however, we expect the participant to immediately sense the slope of the surface during each contact, leading participants to move more horizontally along the surface. We also expect participants to complete the task more quickly and accurately with the 3-DOF and 6-DOF controllers than with the 1-DOF controller, as prior literature suggests that haptic curvature perception is dominated by local surface orientation [33, 47]."

Although this scenario does not present the weight of a held object, we still render the inertial forces associated with accelerating the object.

This condition follows from the assumption that a real disk moves only when static friction between the fnger and the disk is greater than static friction between the disk and the table, as determined by the mass, fnger force, and coefcients of friction. For the three real disks, the required penetration depths are within 1 mm of each other. For the virtual disks, we scale p to account for measurement error and fnger drift associated with trying to keep a fnger stationary in free space. Moving our virtual disks requires a penetration depth, p, of 2 mm for the light disk, 4 mm for the reference disk, and 6 mm for the heavy disk.

This ratio of skin stretch to force is much higher than was reported in [39] and [37], but as was discussed in Sec. 2.4, the Fuppeteer’s end-efector is not perfectly rigid. Our efective stifness accounts for fngertip stifness and end-efector stifness in series, resulting in a lower efective stifness (0.025 N/mm) than for the fngertip shear stifness alone, which Nakazawa et al. report as approximately 0.2 N/mm when contact force is 1 N [29]."

During the 6-DOF rendering of the slider task, when tactile shear is directly related to user acceleration, we still do not fnd a signifcant efect of acceleration on performance.

This approach allowed us to observe naive performance, but it also proved challenging for some participants who never discovered exploration techniques that yielded positive results. If the tactile rendering methods were explained, or if suggested exploratory techniques were provided, users would most likely be better able to discern which techniques work best for a particular task and rendering method, rather than consistently trying the same technique. Alternatively, more exposure time and feedback about answer correctness would most likely have enabled users to discover better techniques on their own but would have increased study duration and fatigue."

We presented rendering algorithms for 1-, 3-, and 6-DOF tactile cues during a shape discrimination and a mass discrimination task. We found that only the 6-DOF tactile feedback allowed both tasks to be completed better than chance, but that the dimensionality of tactile feedback does not strongly afect the exploratory techniques implemented by the user. We hope our work will encourage future tactile device designs that can present a wide variety of virtual interactions and inspire additional research into how tactile dimensionality and individual preference infuence the utility of wearable haptic devices."
