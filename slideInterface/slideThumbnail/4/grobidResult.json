We found that users experienced both FOMO and JOMO. FOMO was caused by the users' awareness of parallel events in the spherical view, but users also experienced JOMO. FOMO did not compromise viewers' sense of presence, and FOMO also decreased in the second viewing session, while JOMO remained constant.

In this paper, we focus on photorealistic 360\u00b0 video and use the terms 360\u00b0 video and Cinematic Virtual Reality (CVR) interchangeably. As users watch one part of the 360\u00b0 view, they will necessarily miss out on other parts of the sphere. Consequently, the fear of missing out (FOMO) on important aspects of the storyline is unavoidable in a 360\u00b0 video viewing experience [2,51,73,75].\nFOMO has been much studied in the context of social media and defned as the feelings of concern and anxiety that can arise when one is presented with a variety of mutually exclusive options and the freedom to choose among them [3,11,13,18,19,46,55]. However, despite expanding consumer use of 360\u00b0 video, studies on FOMO in virtual reality (VR) contexts are sparse. In immersive storytelling, FOMO has been described as a negative factor that distracts users and may compromise their sense of presence [2,51,73].\nThe concept of the joy of missing out (JOMO) has emerged alongside FOMO. JOMO refers to positive feelings, such as joy and excitement, that arise when one has an abundance of mutually exclusive options and the freedom to choose among them [14,22,79]. Similar to FOMO, JOMO is a potentially useful concept for characterizing factors shaping immersive storytelling experiences. Inquiry into FOMO and JOMO in CVR is particularly timely as social, shared VR experiences are becoming more common [44,71,77]. As a result, the FOMO and JOMO that people feel about an abundance of options on social media could translate to VR experiences.\nTo further our understanding of FOMO and JOMO in immersive storytelling, we explored how users experience FOMO and JOMO when viewing a 360\u00b0 video in a head-mounted display. We ask how having the freedom to choose the feld of view (FOV) afects users' FOMO, JOMO, and sense of presence. To accomplish this, we manipulated an aspect of the viewing experience that is normally under the viewer's control: changes in the FOV. We used a split-sphere 360\u00b0 video as a stimulus. In a split-sphere 360\u00b0 video the spherical view is split into two 180\u00b0 parts, with each part representing one perspective on the storyline. To keep up with the story, the user has to rotate actively to change the feld of view (FOV) within the 360\u00b0 sphere. FOMO and JOMO can be particularly salient when viewing such a video. Participants viewed the split-sphere 360\u00b0 video in a mixed-methods, between subjects experiment with four conditions. In the free choice condition, participants had the most freedom to choose the FOV and manage their awareness of parallel events in the 360\u00b0sphere. In two timed rotation conditions, the researchers rotated the participants at 30-or 90-second intervals, so they were aware of the parallel events but could not control rotation. In the 180\u00b0 view condition, viewers could only view half of the sphere.\nWe used a repeated measures design to gauge the evolution of the user experience over the course of two viewing sessions. As consumer VR further penetrates the market and CVR experiences become more common among consumers, users will have the choice to revisit CVR content at will. To our knowledge, previous research has not yet examined how repeated viewings of CVR content might afect the user experience, yet this could be a key contributor to many aspects of the user experience, and especially FOMO and JOMO. Therefore, it is important and timely to examine the efects of repeated viewings on the user experience in immersive storytelling.\nThis exploratory study examines the efect of multiple viewings on FOMO, JOMO, and presence, and takes the frst step towards conceptualizing JOMO in immersive storytelling. Following this, we ofer recommendations for storytellers and designers to better leverage the dynamics of FOMO and JOMO for an enjoyable and immersive 360\u00b0 video viewing experience.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK 2.1 The Fear of Missing Out in 360\u00b0 Video", "text": "Fear of missing out (FOMO) arises in situations in which a user has more than one option. It refers to the anxiety people feel when choosing to do one thing results in missing out on another activity. An abundance of choices can cause anxiety, fear of making a \"wrong\" choice, and, eventually, regret [46]. Most research on FOMO has examined its association with social media use [13,25,34,39,55]. In this context, FOMO has been defned as a pervasive apprehension that others are having more rewarding experiences than oneself and a desire to stay continuously connected with what others are doing by monitoring communication platforms such as social media [13,55]. FOMO is associated with a decreased sense of well-being due to feelings of anxiety, concern, and stress [3,11,13,18,19,55].\nFOMO has also been identifed in VR, particularly in 360\u00b0 video viewing experiences [2,51,60,73]. The omnidirectional view in 360\u00b0 video provides multiple felds of view (FOV) from which the user can choose. By choosing to watch one slice of the 360\u00b0 sphere, the user misses out on events occurring elsewhere in the sphere. 360\u00b0 video can thus cause users to experience FOMO. In CVR, FOMO refers to the viewers' concern about missing important parts of the story [2,47,73]. Previous studies have described FOMO as a negative factor that can distract the user, decrease enjoyment, and risk compromising the immersive experience [2,51,70,73,75,80]. To address these issues and help users focus their attention in the spherical view, designers have started to develop solutions to mitigate FOMO [16,26,63,76]. These solutions include visual indicators and diegetic cues, such as sound and audiovisual guidance, which are provided to the user during the viewing experience [35,48,59]. FOMO, however, could also have positive efects. Newton and Soukup [47] suggest that the awareness of multiple, parallel options for choosing the FOV could nudge the viewer to actively use the full spherical view instead of sticking with only one focal point.\nIn this study, we defne FOMO in 360\u00b0 video as a fear of missing out on parts of the narrative occurring outside of the viewer's current feld of view. Developing a better understanding of the nature of FOMO in the context of 360\u00b0 video will help us understand the user experience of CVR storytelling, compose more engaging stories, and design functional technologies to mediate them. Therefore, we propose the following research question:\nRQ1a How do users experience the fear of missing out (FOMO) in a 360\u00b0 video viewing experience?", "n_publication_ref": 35, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The Joy of Missing Out in 360\u00b0 Video", "text": "Joy of missing out (JOMO) refers to feelings of enjoyment prompted by being able to choose not to participate, to \"opt out\" of keeping up with and engaging in social activities [5,14,22,79]. A key aspect of JOMO is the freedom to choose where to direct one's attention [22,53]. JOMO arises in situations in which the user has an abundance of choices. The user is aware of alternatives and enjoys the opportunity to choose and the choices they make. Although FOMO and JOMO are often framed as opposite, antagonistic factors, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may occur simultaneously during an immersive viewing experience. The user may feel concern and anxiety while trying to capture the full storyline but may also simultaneously experience positive feelings, such as joy and excitement about the choice of content. Thus, the user could experience FOMO and JOMO as co-occurring factors.\nDespite increasing attention to JOMO in the popular press [20,54,57], JOMO remains an understudied phenomenon in academic scholarship. JOMO has been mentioned as an observation in a study about disconnecting from mobile use [4], yet no formal studies about JOMO have been conducted to our knowledge. 360\u00b0 video creates a user experience in which positive feelings similar to JOMO could be present. Freedom to choose the FOV could induce feelings of enjoyment, excitement, and control. In this paper, we examine these positive feelings as JOMO in the 360\u00b0 viewing experience, asking the following question:\nRQ1b How do users experience the joy of missing out (JOMO) in a 360\u00b0 video viewing experience?", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sense of Presence in 360\u00b0 Video", "text": "A key quality of immersive media such as 360\u00b0 video is the user's sense of presence, which refers to the psychological state of experiencing the virtual environment as the one in which the user is consciously present [38,56,65,67]. Spatial or environmental presence refers to the feeling of being in the virtual environment, the sense of \"being there\" [28,33]. Social presence is the feeling of \"being with others\" or perceiving virtual social actors as actual social actors [10,33]. Another aspect of presence is self-presence, also referred to as body ownership or embodiment, which refers to the user's illusory perception of a virtual body as their own-an experience that a frst-person VR experience can create [12,31,41,64,66].\nDecades of work have examined presence and self-presence or body ownership in VR experiences, mostly based on computer generated imagery (CGI) environments [28,33] and computergenerated avatars [24,27,52,61]. More recent studies show that photorealistic 360\u00b0 video can also create a sense of presence similar to CGI-based VR experiences [2,45,69,73,74]. A sense of body ownership may also be possible to achieve in a photorealistic 360\u00b0 video, in which the cameras are rigged on the actors to simulate their frst-person perspectives. The relationship between sense of presence and FOMO/JOMO is unknown, but sense of presence is a key element of an immersive storytelling experiences [15]. We therefore pose the following research question:\nRQ2 What is the association between FOMO and JOMO and users' sense of presence in an immersive video viewing experience?", "n_publication_ref": 25, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Efects of Repeated Viewings on FOMO, JOMO, and Sense of Presence", "text": "Due to the advent of inexpensive consumer VR devices, users can now view 360\u00b0 video content at home. This difers from the past, in which traditional, CGI-based VR experiences mostly took place in research labs. The user experience of watching 360\u00b0 video at home can difer signifcantly from that of lab-based experiences.\nOne diference is that the user can decide to rewatch 360\u00b0 videos at will, similarly to how other consumer content is consumed, such as episodes of television shows. This evolution of the user experience of 360\u00b0 video prompts an important question about how the user's reactions to the virtual content may develop over the course of several viewings, or when the user is aware that they have the option to revisit content. We thus ask: RQ3 How does viewing the 360\u00b0 video content more than once afect FOMO, JOMO, and sense of presence?\n3 METHODS, DATA, AND MEASURES 3.1 Stimulus: 360\u00b0 Split-Sphere Film\nThe stimulus was a 10-minute, fctional 360\u00b0 flm called UTURN produced by NativeVR [43]. The flm is situated in a technology startup in San Francisco. The female engineer and the male CTO are the lead actors. The team's female engineer works hard, but her work goes unrecognized by the company executives. In most scenes, the main characters operate in diferent environments: the female engineer works at the company's ofce, while the male CTO travels to New York to raise funding. The flm shows him at his hotel room and in meetings and dinner with prospective funders. The 360\u00b0 sphere of the flm is vertically divided into two 180\u00b0 spheres, each of which shows one character's frst-person point of view. The two concurrent sides of the story run in parallel: while the user is watching one side, the other main character's narrative also proceeds on the other side. By choosing the FOV in the 360\u00b0 view, the user can watch the engineer solve technical problems or follow the CTO's preparation for the pitch.\nThe flm was shot with a modifed two-camera GoPro rig. The cameras were rigged on the two main actors' heads to provide the viewer a frst-person perspective, allowing the viewer to see part of each main actor's body and hands when looking down. The video has spatialized sound that adjusts according to the user's head position. When the user's view centers on the midline between the two 180\u00b0 sides, the user sees a thin black divider line along with about 30\u00b0 of both views and hears dialogue from both sides. As the user's FOV approaches this midline, sound cues from the other side of the sphere become increasingly audible.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Experiment Design", "text": "The between-subjects, mixed method experiment was conducted in July-September 2018. 119 participants were randomly assigned to watch the video in one of the four conditions: as a 360\u00b0 split sphere in a HMD, freely choosing the FOV in the 360\u00b0 sphere (Condition A, also called \"Free choice\"); as a 360\u00b0 split sphere in a HMD, in timed rotation to another FOV every 30 seconds (Condition B, \"30-second timed rotation\"); as a 360\u00b0 split sphere in a HMD, in timed rotation every 90 seconds (Condition C, \"90-second timed rotation\"); or as a half-sphere 180\u00b0 flm, seeing the flm from start to fnish from each perspective, with the backside of the video being blank (Condition D, \"180\u00b0 view\").\nWhether participants started from the female or male characters' perspective frst was counterbalanced across conditions. In the second round, they started from the opposite perspective. Thus, all participants saw the entire flm over the course of the two sessions. In condition A, participants were free to rotate between the two viewpoints. In condition D, participants watched one 180\u00b0 view from start to fnish in each round. In conditions B and C, the researcher rotated the participants' from one FOV to another at 30or 90-second intervals by rotating the swivel chair. We tracked the rotation time intervals by recording the lap rounds using a stop watch and rotational tracking. If the timing and frequency of the rotation were not consistent, the data were removed. Figure 1 shows the participants' rotational activity in each condition. Participants were not told in advance that they would see the video twice to avoid afecting their experience during the frst viewing session. The two viewing sessions allowed us to examine the evolution of FOMO, JOMO, and presence between the frst and second viewings.\nThe four conditions represented diferent types of viewing experiences, where FOMO, JOMO, and presence could potentially vary. In the free choice condition (A), the user could freely rotate to choose the FOV in the 360\u00b0 sphere to gain awareness of simultaneous events. In the timed rotation conditions (B and C), the user did not have the ability to choose the FOV but had awareness of simultaneous events. The two frequencies for alternating the FOV in Conditions B (every 30 seconds) and C (every 90 seconds) were chosen to vary the degree to which participants had access to simultaneous events occurring on the two sides of the spherical view. The 180\u00b0 viewing modality (Condition D) provided a single perspective on the storyline from start to fnish of a session. The viewer could then get the full story.

Whether participants experienced a condition where they had control over the feld of view, one where their FOV was assigned did not signifcantly efect participants' experience of any category of presence. Furthermore, neither viewing the flm as a 360\u00b0 experience with two parallel storylines (free choice condition [A] and the timed rotation conditions [B and C]), nor viewing it as a more traditional viewing experience from beginning to end in a 180\u00b0 view (180\u00b0 view condition D) afected presence. However, there was a statistically signifcant decrease in participants' sense of spatial and social presence between viewing sessions across all conditions, as shown in Table 3.

A single stimulus, however, has limitations. Every 360\u00b0 video has unique qualities, including the narrative, setting, and technical features such as the production quality. All these factors may afect the viewing experience, and, consequently, FOMO, JOMO, and presence. For instance, if the narrative moves slowly, the user may have more time to pan around in the sphere and focus on other FOVs without feeling a strong fear of missing out on the events. The user may experience less JOMO, but a stronger sense of presence. Conversely, if the narrative moves quickly and there are many interesting audiovisual elements to explore, the user may feel more FOMO and JOMO, while retaining JOMO, but actually revisiting content may also reduce the user's sense of presence over time. but less presence. These qualities can also impact the perceived usability of the viewing experience. We elected to use this specifc video because its novel format provided a unique opportunity to elicit feelings of FOMO and JOMO while controlling for agency in four conditions. Since there were two scenes unfolding on opposite sides of the sphere, users were always sure to be \"missing out\" on content. However, it was possible to watch the flm as a coherent, more traditional-style narrative in the 180\u00b0 viewing condition (D). Thus, our manipulations, such as changing the rate at which users were exposed to diferent FOVs (as in the timed rotation conditions [B and C]), could be as efective as possible.

FOMO and JOMO can be seen as two sides of the same coin: both stem from the awareness of multiple options in the 360\u00b0 sphere, which can prompt both negative and positive feelings. JOMO refers to joy at being able to choose from multiple options, whereas FOMO refers to concern about possibly missing out on important events. Both metrics are associated with the availability of multiple options. FOMO did not compromise presence, indicating that FOMO may not be as distracting a factor in an immersive viewing experience as previously assumed [2,51,73]. Furthermore, viewers can experience FOMO while also experiencing feelings of joy and excitement, even when they cannot access all available options at will. FOMO decreased over time in the free choice condition, while JOMO remained constant. This suggests that when users view a 360\u00b0 video multiple times, they may continue to experience JOMO at similar levels, while FOMO may decrease. Therefore, awareness of the option of multiple viewings could alleviate FOMO, meaning that to a certain extent FOMO could be an artifact of the artifcial constraints of the laboratory in which users are presented with experiences that they know they cannot access again on their own. As 360\u00b0 videos become more commonly viewed in home settings, where users can view the same content multiple times, FOMO may become a less prominent factor in the user-experience. Future work should examine whether merely instructing participants that they can watch the video again can alleviate FOMO while retaining JOMO. While repeat viewings decreased FOMO, they also decreased presence. The awareness of the ability to revisit virtual content may thus help to reduce FOMO", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Implications for Research on FOMO and JOMO", "text": "FOMO has been approached primarily as a negative factor both in CVR and in other realms. The results of this study suggest, however, that FOMO may not be as negative a distraction as previously thought. Future research should thus examine the potential positive implications of FOMO, both in CVR and other contexts, instead of using only a negative framing to the construct. For example, avoiding the negative feeling of FOMO might drive users to investigate multiple options. Moreover, future research should also interrogate further the relationship between FOMO and JOMO, specifcally looking at the mechanisms by which the two mutually infuence each other Visual and diegetic cues can help the user choose the feld of view in the 360\u00b0 sphere and mitigate FOMO. However, such cues may also increase anxiety about choosing the FOV. Finding the right balance between guiding the user within the spherical view and letting the user experience both FOMO and JOMO should be the goal. As Sarker [60] proposes, designers of immersive experiences must fnd \"the sweet spot between boredom and frustration, \" where sufcient cues hint to viewers that they have options, but too many cues may introduce FOMO-anxiety. Moreover, future research should explore how storytelling techniques can be efectively used to hint the viewer of a good time to switch the FOV.\nFuture research should examine the potential of using VR as environments in which people can practice coping with multiple options (FOMO) constructively in their lives and strengthen ability to experience JOMO. VR has been successfully used as a treatment context and a tool in exposure therapy for anxiety and stress disorders [6,17,36,37] and phobias [23,58]. FOMO could prove to be another fear for which VR can provide a safe and controllable treatment environment. Research should aim for developing coping mechanisms for FOMO, and particularly mechanisms that could help the user to transition from FOMO to JOMO -enjoying the awareness of multiple options and choice.\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind the fundamental differences in FOMO and JOMO in CVR compared to other contexts, such as social media. In social media, FOMO is often associated with social comparison of oneself to others, whereas in CVR, FOMO is about what is happening elsewhere in the video, i.e., in the FOVs that the user is not watching. However, as social, shared VR experiences are becoming more common [32,44,71,77], this diference may dissipate to a degree. Social VR experiences could make the element of social comparison more salient in VR and thus expose VR users to a type of FOMO similar to that associated with social media.\nIn CVR, the user has access to multiple options in the 360\u00b0 sphere. Yet, those options are situated entirely within the spherical view and are thus limited by the content and technical afordances of the flm. In addition, the prerecorded nature of 360\u00b0 flm means that FOMO may dissipate entirely when users have the option to rewatch content at will. In contrast, in social media and in life in general, the number of options is much larger, and it may not be possible to reproduce or revisit events. Thus, the causes of FOMO and JOMO vary based on context.\nMoreover, watching a CVR flm is a relatively short time commitment, typically about 10 minutes at most. Consequently, both the negative and positive feelings that emerge during the viewing experience are rather short-term. In contrast, users often use social media continuously and therefore may experience the concern and anxiety of FOMO and happiness of JOMO continuously over long periods of time, leading to greater efects.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Design and Storytelling Implications", "text": "\u2022 Storytellers should focus on increasing users' JOMO instead of only mitigating FOMO. \u2022 JOMO could be increased by adding visual stimuli across the spherical view to notify the viewer of available options and foster joy and excitement about their choices. \u2022 Audiovisual directional cues may help the user to navigate the 360\u00b0 sphere and mitigate the difculty of choosing the FOV. However, such cues may also diminish the joy users derive from discovering elements in the spherical view and reduce their sense of presence. Therefore, the use of directional cues should be carefully considered, weighing their potential impact on both FOMO and JOMO. \u2022 Because presence may decrease upon repeated viewings, storytellers should consider that as presence dissipates, the viewing experience may evolve and viewers may start to attend to other details in the virtual environment. \u2022 Because the users can also experience presence in 180\u00b0 video, storytellers should consider when a 180\u00b0 view is sufcient to achieve the storytelling goals, considering the increased investment of time and efort required to produce 360\u00b0 video vs. 180\u00b0 videos.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This study examined fear of missing out (FOMO), joy of missing out (JOMO), and presence in a 360\u00b0 video viewing experience.
