Many international reports explain how prevalent this problem is from the enlightened western world to the low-resourced Global South. For example, the United Nation Women reported that Up to 70% of women across the world face physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime [8] and National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NIPSV) reported in 2018 that about 1 out of every 5 women (21.3%) in the United States experienced at least one attempted or completed rape [94]. The picture in the Global South is also equally disturbing, if not worse, as 66% of women reported experiencing sexual harassment between two and fve times in Delhi, India [8].\nToday, with the widespread advancement of information technology, this problem has taken over the cyber-spaces. Thus, online gender harassment is a widely discussed agenda across the world. Prior studies have shown that female social accounts experience a significantly larger number of harassment incidents than male accounts [9,20,28,73] and thus, these studies have concluded that women are more vulnerable to online gender harassment. The situation is more difcult in patriarchal societies like Bangladesh, as reports show that more than 70% percent of the complaints fled at the government's Information and Communication Technology Division's Cyber Help Desk in 2017 was about women's online harassment [54]. Such harassment incidents often stress the victims and their families out and lead to other efects like exclusion, humiliation, and public resentment, especially when they live in conservative and patriarchal societies [58]. However, harassers often remain beyond the scope of law-enforcement as Mishuk Chakma, Additional Deputy Commissioner of the Cyber Security and Crime Division of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), commented, \"However, most (female) victims of online harassment do not go to the police station\" [25].\nThe very tiny portion of the female victims of online gender harassment who breaks the silence and seeks help often prefers to expose the harassers on social media with screenshots of their chats as supporting evidence and seek justice [51,56]. Nevertheless, in most cases, the reports and the press releases by concerned authorities show that the many of the victims' attempts to seek help and justice go in vain with the argument that the advancement of technology now allows manipulation of screenshots. Thus, ofenders often receive the beneft of doubts and go away [51,56]. However, the insights on the level of extremeness of online harassment which push the female victims to take such steps and what still blocks them from seeking out help are still rare in HCI literature.\nWe address this gap in the literature through a two-phase study. In the frst phase, we conducted a survey with 91 female Facebook users to understand online gender harassment, and further interviewed another 43 Facebook users for a deeper understanding of their usual strategies to combat such harassment. Previous research on sexual harassment in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan [2-5, 59, 76, 80, 100, 114]; the researchers' lived experience; and similar studies in other places in the world motivated us to seek answers to the following research questions in this phase: RQ1: When and why do Bangladeshi women prefer exposing their online harassers, and what factors are signifcant while choosing possible online spaces for such actions? RQ2: How do the existing tools, platform policies, and online environment often fail to assist them in this regard? RQ3: How do they address the problems when their supporting evidence is challenged for authenticity? How can we design better tools and technologies to support online gender justice in this regard? Our fndings from this frst phase show that their complaints about harassment and supporting evidence are often challenged for authenticity. Building on these, the second phase of the study aimed at designing a tool that supports the women who seek help and justice to their online harassment. We build on the shame-based model of justice in this adversarial design [12,27]. In this regard, we prototyped an application for women to help them seek justice to their online harassment. This paper introduces 'Unmochon', an application that helps with authentication issues associated with the screenshots of the chat history with the harasser that women often share while seeking help and justice. In the second phase of the study, we evaluated this application with 48 participants using either interviews and focus group discussions, depending on their availability and ease in the mode of participation. We introduced this application to the participants, discussed the possible benefts this application would bring for them while fghting gender harassment on Facebook Messenger, and asked them what kind of challenges and troubles this application might generate for the users and other stakeholders. We found that women often prefer hiding their identity as a victim, fearing that this might bring them further victim-blaming and slut-shaming and might even engender real-life security threats. Findings from the users' feedback pointed out that an end to the authenticity problem might still leave the victim and online gender justice challenged by mob-sentiment, hegemonic legal consciousness, and many other privacy concerns. The participants also shared their worries that any misuse of such technologies could lead to a counter-harassment for the accused party and urged to include such concerns in the set of agendas while designing feminist technologies.\nOur work makes a four-fold contribution to feminist-human computer interaction (feminist-HCI), social media studies, and information and communication technologies and development (ICTD). First, our fndings show that many of the Bangladeshi female Facebook users seek mob justice and expose their harassers by posting photos of their conversation online as evidence, while this evidence is often challenged for authenticity. Second, drawing on our fndings, we build a set of design assumptions that are practical and appropriate for assisting such victims in seeking justice. Here, we bring the model of shame-based justice to design [12]. Third, in this regard, we prototype and evaluate Unmochon and report the perception of victims and other stakeholders of such tools that support online gender justice. Finally, we report the fndings from our discussions with the participants and other stakeholders that unfold diferent complicated issues entangled with cyber-harassment and social justice and suggest feminist-HCI and ICTD possible design directions for safer online experience for women in the Global South.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "In building our research question and making arguments based on our fndings, we draw on the literature of three broader themes: technologies supporting women's safety, online movements for gender justice, and literature of justice and gender harassment in Bangladesh.

Researchers in these domains have studied diferent forms of online harassment including cyberbullying [7], cyber-stalking [66,67], email-harassment [68], harassment on messenger [31], and in online gaming [63]. A body of work has showed that online harassment not only stresses the users out but also may cause economic damage to the platform when users choose to leave it or limit their activities [33,66,103].\nEven though most fo the online platforms and social media ofer the users help to handle such cases, users often fnd those processes slow, inconsistent, and dismissive [42,105,106].\nResearchers working in the intersection of social media, web security, and HCI design have been engaging in developing machine learning models to detect harassment for years [12,19,37,61,83,111]. Some of these models have also integrated human to intervene for further efectiveness of the tools [12,19,37,83,111]. However, many of these models were often reported to be trained with a biased mechanism and resulted in higher odds of deception and misclassifcation [11,48]. Along with all of the above-mentioned concerns and limitations, the existing state-of-the-art tools and mechanisms for fghting online harassment often fail to address culturally contextual gendered needs in such cases of harassment, including users' vulnerability due to their gender identity and a balance between their needs and expectation and their power and agency on social media [12,33,91,96,103].\nA group of researchers has recently shown that users' perception of online safety is subjective and dependent on their digital privacy and security and the values upheld by their community [85,88]. Some researchers also engaged in understanding the forms of harassment, its gendered angles, sealioning, and other relevant abuse on social media and called for designing more options in the platforms than blocking harassers and deactivating own IDs in this regard [12,13,88,103]. Jhaver et al. studied Twitter users' blocklists and reported that users might not feel entirely protected by blocking the harassers, while the blocked users often felt that they were unfairly treated [55]. However, the design, features, and afordances of social media, including Facebook, vary across regions (see Facebook lite and messenger lite for the Global South [89]). Thus, users' social media behavior is also diverse and culture-specifc [71,113], which may infuence their ways of handling online harassment.\nHowever, addressing gender harassment using technology is more challenging in low-resourced countries in the Global South because many of the users live in strictly patriarchal societies and raising voice against men is often challenging and usually discouraged through victim-blaming and slut-shaming [3,60,98,99]. Still, a body of work addressed gender harassment in the physical space through design, including Protibadi, ProtibadiNext, Safestreet, and HearMe in Bangladesh [2][3][4][5], Harassmap in Egypt [115], Safe Mathare in Kenya [41], CrimeID in Indonesia [110], and Safetipin, Samrisa, and Panic-button in India [60,95,102]. However, only a few HCI4D works have addressed gender harassment on social media, messenger services, and cyberspaces in the context of the Global South [59,76,100,112,114]. Wyche reported how Kenyan women on cyber-spaces are more vulnerable to online harassment than men [112]. Kumar et al. reported how stalkers and strangers on Facebook demotivated Indian women's social media use [59]. Mustafa et al. reported how Pakistani women formed women-only Facebook groups as a safer and judgement-free space to discuss stigmatized topics [114]. Recently, Nova et al. 's work on understanding the pattern of sexual harassment on social media in Bangladesh [80] revealed how people close to women harass them anonymously using social media. However, none of these works involves any preventive design interventions to stop such online harassment or support the victims seeking gender justice.", "n_publication_ref": 63, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Online Gender Movements and Protests", "text": "Throughout history, online gender movements often sought solidarity while protesting an idea of injustice and invited others who shared similar sentiments to join. For example, two of the signifcant Muslim feminist online movements, #PinkHijabday, and #MuslimahPride took place in the US and Germany basing on ideological conficts [87,107]. Black feminist agendas hold a signifcant part of online movements when it comes to protesting against gendered and racial injustice. For example, #SayHerName started in 2015 to tell the story of violence against black women while circumventing traditional media barriers [109]. It started with the idea of making the sexual assaults and deaths of black transgender women noticeable and urging justice for them. Similarly, #JadaPose and #JusticeforLiz are widely known for seeking justice for black rape-victims [47,108]. These movements spoke for black women's historic racist oppression and pioneered many other online gender justice movements by marginalized communities.\nArguably the most prominent online movement broke the internet in October 2017, in which women across the world used the hashtag #MeToo (or some variants of it) and publicly shared their untold stories of being sexually harassed [92]. Founded in 2006 by Tarana Burke, a black woman activist from New York [16,17,92], these events followed Hollywood actress Alyssa Milano's call on Twitter: \"If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote 'Me too' as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem\" on October 15, 2017 [39]. This call for sharing harassment experiences with #MeToo hashtag followed Milano's own story of being sexually abused [74], and millions of women joined this movement. Some researchers see #MeToo as a descendent of #MyHarveyWeinstein, #YouOkSis, and #Sur-vivorPrivilege movements [44,76] and argue that it only gained prominence when several Hollywood female celebrities came out with their stories of sexual harassment [90].\nWhen #MeToo reached the Indian subcontinent, many women fooded Twitter and other social media platforms with the stories of their sexual harassment [45,65,76]. Cohering to the movement, Sarkar, a Dalit Queer, prepared a list of harassers in Indian Academia [35]. In this regard, Sarkar found that the victims did not provide any context while reporting their harassment incidents, and only a few academicians on the list were \"proved\" guilty [23,90]. Also, showbiz celebrities exposed their harassment stories declaring their solidarity [24,70]. While this movement successfully triggered the academia, industry, and showbiz, the harassment of many women from other professions and social status remained beyond its scope, as it happened in 2012 #SlutWalk movement in India [75]. Reports showed that #MeToo in Bangladesh was also less successful than expected because of cultural diferences, lack of hope, and a lacking reliance on alternatives [45,76]. However, not all the online movements stay unsuccessful in the Indian subcontinent. For example, protest against increased tax on female hygiene products [#LahukaLagaan, see [29]] is known to be one of the biggest womenled Twitter campaigns to demand policy change in India. This body of works provokes us to investigate which factors infuence such protests to be successful and how to integrate these factors while designing to support women's online gender justice.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Model of Justice and Gender Harassment in Bangladesh", "text": "Finally, we turn to the literature of justice relevant to our context and research questions. Prior works on gender justice showed that many female victims of street harassment are reluctant to report to police and law enforcement authorities since those may not have been much helpful previously, and the investigations may lead to the next level of inconvenience and invite another harassment to themselves [52]. Also, reports show that women often feel that their reports to law-enforcement authorities may also bring them shame and blame for supposedly provocative behavior [52]. Another study revealed that such incidents often leave great stress on women, make them feel helpless, and further limit their mobility [3]. Reportedly, women are generally uncomfortable engaging in discussions regarding such harassment incidents because there are some social backlashes of bringing attention to street harassment, and disclosure of such incidents may also bring further shame and embarrassment for the female victims [3]. It has been reported that women often vent their frustration regarding such incidents on social media and disclose their experience to friends, peers, or followers [6,26]. Some tools and interventions were also developed to support such agenda of gender justice sought online by disclosing identifers, an image of the face of the harasser, for example, [26].\nThe reports on seeking justice online in the context of Bangladeshi gender harassment also cohere with this pattern, as we see from the reports [25,54]. In most cases, women were reportedly fed up with the response from the existing infrastructure of legal and social support, and thus, they found alternatives by exposing and shaming the harassers in front of internet-citizens, often termed as 'Netizens'. This model of seeking justice aligns with the idea of 'Mob Justice'. Mob Justice is defned as, \"Ruling by a group of mass\" [43,57]. Here the Netizens constitute the mob who decide the conviction. Although a part of such justice models seems to be unpredictable public opinion, mob justice has often been diferentiated as a model of justice when proper democratic participation is missing in a justice system, and people feel in-secured and lose their faith in legal systems [82]. This practice of Bangladeshi women seeking mob justice also excites one of our research questions.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Authenticity of Image Contents", "text": "Now, we turn to some of the trendy reports on the authenticity of image contents on social media, which is associated with our third research question. With the advancement of technologies, users today can aford their image processing tools in their mobile phones, and thus, it is straightforward to edit and forge images and other multiple media contents [36,40]. A body of work has investigated such cases where people faked images and caused trouble, including communal riot [40,81,93,104]. For example, in 2013, thousands of miscreants gathered near the Buddhist colony in Coxsbazar in Bangladesh and launched a riot after the spread of a rumor that stated that one of the residents of the colony demeaned the Quran. The miscreants claimed that they saw a screenshot of the Facebook post taken from the suspected resident's Facebook profle, and later it was found that the image was forged [93]. Thus, image forgery has become a crucial topic of research with the widespread progress of social media.\nBeing concerned with the harmful efects of fake images, image processing research has progressed with a rich body of literature on this topic [49,50,62,79]. This body of work has been developing techniques to check authenticity and detect fake images on social media for a long time [72,101,116]. However, most of them are developed and tested for efciency in lab environments, and many of them require machines with a higher capacity to compute [72,116]. However, many of the end-users of Bangladesh may not be able to aford such machines' cost, and thus they might not beneft from them.

We hosted our anonymous online survey on Google Survey and circulated it online, including emails of the authors' friends and Facebook groups, which the authors' frequently used.

Thirtynine of the survey respondents reported that they were forced to go in a romantic relationship, date them, or marry them [see fg-1(left)].

In many cases, the female victims are often cursed for numerous reasons, including their working or studying outside and their attire as a justifcation for their harassment. Four of our interview participants were Hindu females, and all of them mentioned that their online harassers frequently used anti-Hindu mockery. (c) Venting Out Random Frustration. Our survey informs that seventeen participants' harassers called them over the phone or messenger call services and initiated threatening and inappropriate conversations. Twenty-one participants received threatening and erotic texts, or vulgar messages, inappropriate audio clips, and multimedia contents from unknown accounts.

Twenty-seven of our interview participants informed us that they think it is better to ignore the harasser silently. Seventy-fve of our survey respondents and 23 of the interview participants mentioned that they had blocked their harassers on social media. However, blocking does not end the story in many cases, especially when the harassers are desperate and fearless. As one of the interview participants explained, \"My friend was harassed by a man from her village. He used to text her asking out and my friends never agreed. He sent awful (sexually explicit content) things and scared her to marry him. No matter how many times she blocked his phone number on her phone and his Facebook IDs, it did not help.

During this COVID-19 situation, we found a similar story of four other participants whose online-class teachers harassed them, and they could not even block them as they wanted to continue their education. Thus, our study found that when women were harassed by their known people, they tried blocking and ignoring, but those did not solve their problems for many reasons.\n(b) Report to Platforms and Rightful Authorities. Twentythree of our interview respondents reported their unknown harassers on the social media platform they used. Nevertheless, the process of reporting to the social media platform often also suggested them to block that person, which was impractical in many cases. Furthermore, online harassment within professional groups was more challenging for women to handle. Our study collected thirteen cases where women's online harassment happened in their work-spaces. Two of the victims complained to their higher ofcials, and their cases were resolved with minimum punishment, as one of the respondents shared her friend's experience, \"Her teammate wanted to date her, and she ignored. He cursed her in texts and emails.

Our participants mentioned several reasons that infuence online gender harassment victims to expose their harassers online. These reasons include: i) many of the victims fnd justice in shaming the harassers in public, ii) women want to warn others to be aware of the harassers, iii) exposing the harassers online help them prove the case of harassment, and iv) in many cases, exposing helps to push the formal reporting to the rightful authorities. We discuss these reasons below.\n(a) Justice in Shaming. Sometimes women facing harassment feel that exposing their harassers should be a possible response while seeking gender justice. Twenty-one of the interview participants mentioned that they think shaming is the way to prevail when it is challenging to bring the harassers under justice through social, professional, and legal systems. One of the participants who lived in a small town shared a story of a school teacher who harassed her and many other girls over messengers.\n\"He picked the under-performing girls, sent them porn images, and forced the conversation. If someone refused, then he would complain to her parents that she is inconsistent with studies. Some girls fnally exposed his actions. Now he is known as a predator in the town; he has lost most of his private tuition. Now, he should be shamed in public. \", (P37) Thus, 15 interview participants mentioned that they have considered exposing or have exposed their harasser by publishing the harassment stories and a copy of their conversations, if available, in public. The victims believed that this would impact harassers' social and professional life, which is the punishment they deserve.\n(b) Blowing the Whistle to Warn Others. 9 of the interview participants who went to the same university mentioned a similar story of a harasser at the university who harassed many female students in their Facebook inbox and later got exposed to a Facebook group related to that university. One of the participants explained the story to us, \"My roommate's harassers harassed a few more girls we knew. However, she never reported his as she was afraid that he might get vindictive. Meanwhile, his harassment stories started coming out in (name of the group). My friend and I convinced a male friend to share screenshots from our side to show more victims of this harasser. And we wanted to tell the other female students that they should be aware of this person. \", (P29) Thus, these female participants mentioned that they did not see prevailing justice only through punishment or shaming, but through fnding a way that no person becomes a victim of the same thing again. They also explained that since society is patriarchal and men are considered superior here, it is an injustice to a girl not to inform her about the predators around them.\n(c) Releasing the Burden of Proof. Thirteen of our participants pointed out that often they were asked to submit proofs whenever they raised their voice against their harassers. In many cases, their cases are dismissed because they do not save those or post those. One of the participants was involved in organizing an event with many senior alumni at her school, and one of them harassed her online. He kept asking her to spend some 'quality time' as he termed that way. When she raised her voice against it, she was shut because of a lack of proof, as she explained, \"He repetitively sent strange texts using secret message mode (on Facebook Messenger). Once the celebration was over, I posted the story on the school alumni group with a copy of our chat a few seconds ago. However, his friends asked me where is the proof that he ridiculed me consistently and why am I saying it now... I wish I saved the previous texts as well. \", (P23) The participant further explained that how the friends of that harasser started dogpiling. Another 5 participants also shared a similar pattern of such experiences when people asked for proofs even for repetitive harassment incidents.\n(d) Exposing is Reporting. As we showed that sometimes formally reporting to the concerned authorities failed and dismissed, organizing mini-movements on social media against the harassers might help establish gender justice. For example, here is a story that one of the interview participants shared. A renowned professor in their department was accused of online gender harassment. Initially, some of his students and colleagues denied accepting that because of his skyrocketing reputation. We quote one of the interview participants, \"When the frst girl raised her voice on Facebook, they challenged her by asking, \"Did he really harass you in the chat?\". Then she gave screenshots, and they said she made it up. Then gradually, more women came out, some from other universities and even school kids who got connected to him through a competition. Some girls claimed that they formally reported at the university, but their cases were dismissed as he is a star professor. Finally, when he lost his reputation, the university stepped in and fred him. \", (P20) Our participants mentioned that sometimes it is difcult to start a conversation on harassment due to fear of further victim-blaming and slut-shamming. Thus, 17 women mentioned that while reporting these to anyone outside their friends, women should either use a fake ID --possibly as male one -to hide behind it and avoid victim-blaming and slut-shaming, or request a male friend to speak for them for more credibility. But even then, they are frequently challenged for proving the authenticity of the evidence that they present. All of our interview participants and 29 online survey participants mentioned that either they faced this challenge of authentication or they did not complain to avoid such challenges. They all highlighted this as an important obstacle toward getting gender justice for online harassment.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Summary and What is Missing", "text": "The frst phase of the study reported three major aspects of online harassment in Bangladesh. First, we found that women are often victim-blamed and slut-shamed for the harassment they suffer from. Therefore, they generally prefer to keep the harassment incidents secret. Sometimes, they share these stories with their friends and solicit possible solutions. Sometimes, they also try to locally solve this issue while hiding their identity. Second, those who choose to break the silence, respond to the harassment by exposing the harasser before the public with evidence of the history of the conversation, as getting gender justice to their immediate social connections often seems improbable. Thus, they show solidarity to other victims if harassed by the similar type of harassers. Third, the victims of such harassment cases often face backlash from the people they seek support from as those people often deny to believe the harassment stories. In such cases, even if the victims present the screenshots, often those people are skeptical about the authenticity of the screenshots, and they tend to reject the complaint without taking a deeper look into it.\nAmong all the challenges regarding online gender harassment in Bangladesh, we pick evidence-authentication problem for design. We did not prioritize this objective over the other design needs, but to complement them. The professionals working for police informed us that confrming the authenticity of digital evidence of harassment is challenging and the forensic procedure is also complicated. Still, they try to work it out by either in-person evidence collection or videos of chat where they get to see the harassers' ID. However, this complicated process further discourages the victims from seeking legal help. Today, this part of the design of social media is poor. Widely used social media platforms in Bangladesh, including Facebook, miss a feature that would help online gender harassment victims prove the authenticity of their harassment evidence and help them engage in conversation with law enforcement organizations to establish online gender justice with minimum hassle.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DESIGNING 'UNMOCHON': A TOOL SUPPORTING GENDER JUSTICE", "text": "We draw on the fndings from the survey responses and the interviews and translated those into the design.

One of our pre-design interview participants discussed an idea of a hypothetical anti-harassment tool and named that 'Unmochon'. Later, we borrowed it from them. This section describes our design goals and components of the application followed by the details of implementation.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Design Goals", "text": "Our fndings from the pre-design survey and interviews inform us of the denial that the victim receives while seeking online gender justice. Therefore, we set our objective to help women collect evidence of their harassment in a way that could be accepted as authentic by the concerned ones. We borrow the idea of shaming from shame-based design for gender justice [12]. We select Facebook as the platform for the deployment since Facebook is one of the most widely used social media platforms in Bangladesh. We draw on our fndings to determine four design goals necessary for a successful online anti-gender harassment tool:\nG1: Capture Screenshot with Authenticity. The participants described scenarios where they saw general people on Facebook being suspicious of the screenshots being true. In some cases, the screenshots were manipulated and some words were replaced. This kind of scenario urge us to set the goal to design a tool that captures the screenshot with minimum or no option of moderation. G2: Confrm that the Facebook Account in the Chat and Facebook Account Being Accused is the Same. In some cases, someone opened a cloned Facebook ID of a particular person, pretended to be him, and harassed women over the chat to defame him. This scenario urges to set the goal to design a tool that confrms that Facebook account in the chat and Facebook account being accused is the same. This will also make sure that no innocent individual gets reported and shamed in this process. G3: Hide the Identity of the Victims. Some of the participants reported that they would prefer opening another Facebook account or requesting friends to make the case on behalf of them so that they would stay behind the curtain and avoid victim-blaming and slut-shaming. Thus, our third goal of the design is to create such an afordance and lessen women's dependency on others.\nG4: Share Screenshot in Public. In most cases, victims share the evidence of harassment in public to shame the harasser, fnd more victims of the same harasser and share moral support, and seek mob justice.\nOur fnal goal is built on this existing practice and we aim to create a convenient platform for them to share their evidence and proof of its authenticity with minimum hassle.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Components and Workfow of Unmochon", "text": "From the user needs and design goals arising from the interviews, we prototyped Unmochon.

The initial version of the plugin that we used for the study only works on the Chrome browser. It is developed on Java Platform. Taking Screenshot. Once the plugin is installed, the welcome window pops up with a button on it saying 'Take Screenshot'. After pressing the button, the application will allow the users with 10 seconds to set up their Facebook messenger chat thread on the Chrome browser of which they want to capture the screenshot. Once the 10 seconds is over, it will automatically capture a screenshot and copy the URL from the address bar that shows the unique Facebook ID number of the account with which the user had a chat and took a screenshot of.\nHiding Identifers. Upon capturing the screenshot, the application opens the editing window that allows the users to use the drawing pen only so that they can hide their own name, display picture in the thumb and any related sensitive information, which they prefer not to the public (see the components and the fow in fg-3 (left)). Once they are done hiding such identifers, the application allows them to save the image of the chat and set it ready for sending it to the server for further process.

The mechanism also detects the mode of the reports by analyzing if the user has kept their identifers (mode-1) or hidden those (mode-2) in the sent image, before sending it to the Facebook group. Thus a package of four items is sent to the Facebook group, the image, the victim's requested mode and Facebook account number, accused harasser's Facebook account number, and how many times the same Facebook account number has previously been reported as a harasser.

Once the package from the server arrives at the group and requests posting, the admins check if the report is a spam. In cases of garbage-posting, the admins would disapprove the posts and remove them from the list of pending requests on the Facebook group. There could be two types of mode of reporting. If it is 'mode-1', then the post comes with the victim's name and Facebook account number, the screenshot of the harassment chat-history, the accused harasser's Facebook account number, and how many times this person has been reported previously.

They discussed a hypothetical scenario where someone manipulated the browser with its metaelements, then captured the screenshot and hid the identifers. In the same conversation, one of the participants suggested a possible solution to such scenario could be to let the application report the screenshot along with metadata of the page. Also, they suggested that the tool should reload the page by itself automatically before it captures the screenshot, to avoid possible manipulation in the chat through some advanced engineering with the HTML elements of the page. Concerning this point, one of them suggested developing this as a mobile app. 10 of our FGD participants anticipated that once such a tool is available, the server will be fooded with reports and many of those might be just random people sending random reports which might have nothing to do with harassment. They also proposed that this tool needs an intelligent flter to select and let in harassment-related posts only. Also, in these conversations, the participants discussed the need for a guideline to defne harassment. Another group of 4 participants raised a concern that if the harasser is wise, then they would immediately know which one of the victims of them have reported just by seeing the screenshot in the report.

We categorize them into hegemonic legal consciousness of the stakeholders in the conversation of gender justice; many aspects of mob justice on social media and how those infuence gender justice; and ofenders' privacy, and discuss them below. 6.2.1 Hegemonic Legal Consciousness. One of our interview participants, P61, is a lawyer and she informed us that institutional justice in Bangladesh is not transparent and female-friendly. The system is inclined more towards power-politics. Thus, often the victims fnd it easier to seek justice in social shaming. She told us some of the stories from the cases of gender harassment which she recently handled and shared her experience with us as a relevant example. A female debater developed an intimacy with another fellow male and that afnity turned toxic at some point. Later, the female debater turned in a written complaint to their association and accused the male colleague of gender harassment on messenger inbox in a particular social media. As P61 explained, \"The female submitted some screenshots of their chat history to their association to make the case of harassment. Then the accused ofender submitted some evidence from earlier chat histories to prove that they were in a romantic relationship at some point and claimed that the female colleague is accusing him of harassment to break his upcoming marriage. On the basis of the submitted evidence, the association came to the conclusion that the female colleague was NOT harassed, but the male colleague should also have behaved himself. \" (P61) P61, thus, explained how gender, social position, and other hegemony infuence the transparency in the model of justice in Bangladeshi society, including professional spaces. She further stretched this conversation and explained how such a social and professional setting often disregards women's sensitivity to their online harassment. She pointed out that it would be generally difcult for women to seek out online gender justice, even with technology like Unmochon.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Mob", "text": "Justice on Social Media. Our participants brought up several challenges while seeking gender justice on social media. During our discussion with one of the male participants, he informed us that communication skill matters the most in seeking online mob justice. He explained, \"When a female victim exposes the online harasser to the online community shared by both of them, often her communication skill plays a role here. Sometimes people visit the victim's Facebook profle and thoroughly investigate if she looks suspicious. If she wears modern clothes, then people often redirect the case and say she was asking for it. Often women lose control over their temper at that point and start fghting. However, if the victim stays calm, ignores the slut-shamming, and responds to the audiences with relevant evidence then the victim wins their support. \" (P73)\nIn the same discussion, he added that storytelling is also equally important. When a woman keeps telling a consistent story on social media and if the clues that she leaves connect to reality and to the version spoken by the other stakeholders, then that story is widely accepted and the victim is likely to be trusted by the people. Therefore, how the evidence is compiling into a coherent narrative rather than a scattered truth often makes the diference, as he explained, \"There could be multiple versions of the same story. But it is the woman's burden to speak out the version in a way that aligns with plausibility. If she sounds strange and illogical in view of the public, then her claims are denied. For example, a group of words, \"I really need to meet you this evening, if you do not meet me then that is going to be a problem\" could mean a lot of things. People will be curious about why the accused person wanted to meet her. People on Facebook would say it is her job to provide more context and coherent evidence so that it can be categorized as harassment and not some business or real needs. \" (P73) 8 of the interview participants also were concerned by the standard of judgment by the people on Facebook as there are diverse groups of people with diferent ideologies and philosophies. They were concerned about who would decide the metrics in a complex social setting of multiple moralities, as they expressed it this way, \"There are diferent types of people on Facebook. Some are extremely patriarchal, some are extremely conservative. There are also people who are against women using Facebook since they think women meeting unknown people on Facebook, losing their purdah and this is against the women's purity concept in their practicing Muslim ideology. So when a woman comes and seeks justice here, if she has any such people in the community in front of which she is trying to establish her requited gender justice, they might face a backlash as the mob would say she should have not talked to men or create a scope to let the men talk to her. They might say she invited it. So in such cases, even if she proves that the harassment was true, she might still fail to establish justice because of this blame. \" (P64) 13 of our participants pointed to the fact that the idea of exposing the ofender in front of the online community shared by both of the parties using the screenshot of chat history repetitively might lessen the gravity of their complaints and could be problematic for them. Thus, the community is involved in the process of investigation and may become curious about further details which might be irrelevant to the complaint made, but later those can be subject to some other harassment. For example, P67 explained the story of one of her female friends, \"A few months back, my friend frst complained against a male classmate in our class's Facebook group with no solid proof. Many of the group-members found that baseless and dismissed her accusation. Recently, when she complained against the same person again, the harasser and his fellows said that she was deliberately doing this again and pointed to the previously dismissed complaint. Many people in the group then dissed her recalling her previous complaint, my friend felt sick and left the group. \" (P67) Thus, our participants informed us through many discussions that securing online gender justice with mob would need not only authentic evidence but how the victim communicates and how they align with mob sentiment are equally important factors in this regard.

However, through the demo, this group of participants fgured that out-of-context messages and garbage-posting would be disapproved by the admins before posting on the Facebook groups. They also fgured that our system already also allowed the community to facilitate a conversation with the accused in order to avoid such tricky cases, including the misuse of consensual conversations. The participants emphasized that such cases should be handled with more carefully and compassionately, since those could directly afect the reputation of both of the parties, and might also impact the efectiveness of our design.\nFive of our interview participants also pointed that the harasser might make a case of their privacy breaching if a victim share their personal conversation in front of a wider audience.

Previous literature on women empowerment in the context of the Global South showed that women here were socially and culturally trained to accept or ignore their harassment and not seek out external help [3,99]. In this work, we showed that many women in Bangladesh still sought justice to their online harassment that took place on chat messenger by raising their voice against the harasser on social media.

With our study, we have extended this line of literature to the context of the Global South, where the users and multiple stakeholders often hold diverse and tangential agendas in a given social setting [3]. Our study found that the intersection of social support and law in Bangladesh is a complex space for designing gender justice for women. Our work found that many of our participants were harassed by their friends and family members. Thus, their online harassment cases were not solvable by just blocking the harasser. Furthermore, we show that although often women seeking gender justice online are dissed and humiliated by online populations, they still seek support from the community via friends or using a fake Facebook ID. We have also shown that victims often believe that their sporadically and locally organized small-scale protests might help them more than legal systems, and we have listed many reasons for their belief. All of these angles rising from the fndings of our study lead us to argue that technology should be designed to balance and bridge between social support and legal perspective to support the victims better.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Women's Agency, Shaming Platform, and Transformative Justice", "text": "Our design strategy aligns with the spirit of Feminist methods (complaining, exposure, and refusal) that help women strengthen their voice within a patriarchy [69]. In many patriarchal societies, including Bangladesh, many men consider the women they are related to as their properties, and any disrespect and injustice to \"their women\" hurt these men. Thus, women's harassment is also considered a misdeed conducted against the men and is often regarded as a matter worth seeking justice. Our fndings join the existing body of South Asian Feminist-HCI work by Sultana et al. [99], Ahmed et al. [3], Kumar et al. [60,64], Mustafa et al. [78], among others and show that many women give up on remaining shy, raise their voices against such online harassment, and grow solidarity being within their community. Thus, they adapt complaining, exposure, and refusal as feminist methods of empowerment within the patriarchal society. We integrate these design strategies to create a platform of empowerment and solidarity that works \"within\" the patriarchal system, to help women make their complaints stronger, and to help them further gain more agency.\nIn this work, we highlight the transformative aspect of the design that we implemented through 'Unmochon.' Transformative design is based on a broad idea of fairness. Instead of punishing an individual for a crime, transformative justice investigates why that person committed that crime. This aspect allows us to fnd deeper problems in our society, including poverty, discrimination, lack of education, lack of social support, lack of good childhood, etc., which contribute to making a person criminal [22,38,77]. Transformative justice, hence, focuses on fxing those bigger issues [21]. This happens in three channels: (a) restoring the social imbalance caused by the individuals through social support, (b) changing the mindset of individuals who committed a crime through education and social support, and (c) addressing the bigger social problem that contributed to making a person commit crimes. Thus, transformative justice provides a way to reduce crime in a society in a more sustainable way.\nOne of the design principles of Unmochon is 'shaming' which may be interpreted as an adversarial action toward punishing someone for their misconduct. However, shaming also provides a person with a way to refect on what they have done from their social peers and repent for that. Therefore, shaming may reduce crime in a society [15]. The social process of shaming often also involves seeking forgiveness and committing not to repeat the crime. At the same time, social pressure is imposed on the person that keeps them away from a repetition of the same crime. The perpetrator then gets an opportunity to learn and change their behavior and mindset. At the same time, the discourse that is created around a shaming incident allows the society to refect on the broader picture of the societywhere the perpetrators are coming from? why is this happening? how can we put a stop to this? how can families, communities, and societies come together to fx the problem?. Such conversations often lead to social welfare activities. From this perspective, we hope that Unmochon also creates a platform for transformative justice. Having said that, we do also acknowledge that the actual happening of the transformative design largely depends on how people will use this platform, and there are chances that many people may only focus on the immediate punishment part of shaming. However, we believe that, given enough time, more and more people will start focusing on the long-term sustainable solutions to the problem, and the transformative aspects of Unmochon will prevail.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "LIMITATIONS OF THE WORK", "text": "Our work has several limitations. First, both online and real-life gender harassment is a stigma-topic in Bangladesh and for that reason, recruiting participants was challenging for us. Most of the interview and focus group discussion participants are recruited through snowball sampling and thus, they are mostly the people from the researchers' primary and secondary networks. Since we recruited the participants through convenient sampling, our work is not free from participation bias and selection bias. Thus, the opinions of our participants and arguments driven from the interviews and FGDs may not represent the collective view of the women of the whole nation. Second, we failed to engage with any participant of the third gender due to our limited reach. Thus, we did not gain any insight into their experiences of harassment and their opinion about our tool. Despite these limitations, the fndings of our study will be useful for feminist technology design in the context of low-resource and patriarchal settings. Also, the arguments and lessons from this study will contribute to women-empowerment policy-making in Bangladesh and other countries with a similar resource, environment, and social setting.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In future iterations of the design, we plan to overcome or minimize some of the limitations of the existing version. Our user-evaluation also pointed to some of the necessary future design iterations. First, we prototyped our tool for Facebook messenger only. Our participants mentioned that they use Imo, Viber, Whatsapp, and other text messaging services frequently and face gender harassment on those platforms as well. Following their suggestions, one of the future work could be developing similar tools for Imo, Viber, Whatsapp, and other text messaging services that they use. Second, Our participants pointed out that sometimes it is difcult to explain the whole story of harassment just using one image and thus, the ofenders often go away taking the beneft of the doubt. In the existing version of the prototype, there is no way to collage multiple screenshots in the same report to explain the fow of the conversation. Our participants requested such functionality in the future iteration of the design. Third, this version of the prototype does not support submitting the evidence to police directly, although it fulflls some of the qualities and matches the protocol of the standard legal evidence collection followed by the Bangladeshi police in cases of cyber-crimes. This fact opens up a new opportunity for us to design technologies supporting gender justice within legal spheres. Fourth, in our future work, we will investigate how this system will be recognized by diferent Bangladeshi institutions and how that would impact their policies. The existing version of our system allows the users to develop informal community-based legitimate women-support groups (often consisted of senior women, in Bangladesh) that are not necessarily tied to a formal institution.\nIn future, we aim to develop platforms for better communication between the victim, the informal support network, and the formal authorities.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we present a deeper understanding of online gender harassment faced by Bangladeshi female social media users. Our work makes a four-fold contribution to feminist-human computer interaction (feminist-HCI), social media studies, and information and communication technologies and development (ICTD). First, our fndings show that many of the Bangladeshi female Facebook users seek mob justice and expose their harasser by posting photos of their conversation online as evidence, while this evidence is often challenged for authenticity. Second, drawing on our fndings, we build a set of design assumptions that are practical and appropriate for assisting such victims in seeking justice. Here, we bring the model of shame-based justice to design [12]. Third, in this regard, we prototype and evaluate Unmochon and report the perception of victims and other stakeholders of such tools that support online gender justice. Findings from the users' feedback pointed out that an end to authenticity problem may still leave the victim and online gender justice challenged by mob-sentiment, hegemonic legal consciousness, and many other privacy concerns. Finally, we report fndings from our discussions with the participants and other stakeholders that unfold diferent complicated issues entangled with cyber-harassment and social justice and suggest feminist-HCI and ICTD possible design directions for safer online experience for women in the global south.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Mechanism design for social good", "journal": "AI Matters", "year": "2018", "authors": "Rediet Abebe; Kira Goldner"}, {"title": "Protibadinext: Sensor support to handle sexual harassment", "journal": "", "year": "2016", "authors": "Nova Ahmed; Rahat Sadd Azmeen Ur Rahman; Tanvir Jahangir Rony; Vikram Mushfque;  Mehta"}, {"title": "Protibadi: A platform for fghting sexual harassment in urban Bangladesh", "journal": "ACM", "year": "2014", "authors": "Ahmed Syed Ishtiaque; J Steven; Nova Jackson;  Ahmed;  Hasan Shahid Ferdous;  Md Rashidujjaman Rifat; Shamir Rizvi; Rifat Sabbir Ahmed;  Mansur"}, {"title": "Hearme: A smart mobile application for mitigating women harassment", "journal": "IEEE International WIE Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering", "year": "2016", "authors": "Md Saad Ahmed Akash; Tamal Al-Zihad;  Adhikary"}, {"title": "SafeStreet: empowering women against street harassment using a privacy-aware location based application", "journal": "ACM", "year": "2015", "authors": "Shabnam Mohammed Eunus Ali; Lazima Basera Rishta; Tanzima Ansari; Ahamad Imtiaz Hashem;  Khan"}, {"title": "Understanding social media disclosures of sexual abuse through the lenses of support seeking and anonymity", "journal": "", "year": "2016", "authors": "Nazanin Andalibi; Munmun De Oliver L Haimson; Andrea Choudhury;  Forte"}, {"title": "Designing cyberbullying mitigation and prevention solutions through participatory design with teenagers", "journal": "", "year": "2016", "authors": "Zahra Ashktorab; Jessica Vitak"}, {"title": "Facts and Figures", "journal": "", "year": "2020", "authors": " Un Women -Asia-Pacifc"}, {"title": "Sofa Patel, Rebekka Rumpel, and Simon Wibberley", "journal": "", "year": "2014", "authors": "Jamie Bartlett; Richard Norrie"}, {"title": "UBICOMP 2009 Workshop CFP: Globicomp -Taking Ubicomp Beyond Developed Worlds from Julie Kientz", "journal": "", "year": "2009-02", "authors": "Russell Beale; Nicola Bidwell; Eli Blevis; Stephen Brewster; Anxo Cereijo Roibas; Keith Cheverst; Andrew Deardon; Jussi Impio; A Amit; Abigal Navavati; Yvonne Sellen; Lucia Rogers;  Terrenghi"}, {"title": "Like trainer, like bot?
